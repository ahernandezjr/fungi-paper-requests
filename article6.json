   "text": "INTRODUCTION New and Interesting Fungi (NIF) is introduced as a new series of papers that will supplement other series focussed on expanding existing knowledge of fungal biodiversity and fungal conservation. Another similar series such as the Fungal Planet (www.fungalplanet.org) aims to provide a rapid and simplified outlet for researchers to describe new fungal species as well as to highlight the environments where these fungi were isolated. The Fungal Planet series established in 2006 emphasises a holistic conservation of all life on the planet including not only plants and animals but also fungi (Crous et al. 2017a, b). This new series of papers focusses not only on new fungal taxa but also on those that are generally interesting and that deserve notice. Like other series including the already mentioned Fungal Planet, the Genera of Fungi (GoF) series (Crous & Groenewald 2017, Giraldo et al. 2017), the Genera of Phytopathogenic Fungi (GOPHY) series (Marin-Felix et al. 2017), and the Fungal Systematics and Evolution series (Crous et al. 2015a, Hernandez-Restrepo et al. 2016, Krisai-Greilhuber et al. 2017) it has become evident that there are many undescribed species of fungi and new host or geographical records for which a scientific repository is lacking. Most of these could easily never be described or catalogued, and thus being lost to science. This justified the decision to launch the new series New and Interesting Fungi (NIF). It is hoped that this series will provide an attractive vehicle for mycologists to publish single new species or to highlight the relevance of important fungi. Many known fungal species need to be recollected and epi- or neotypified in order to secure the application of old names already in use and resolve their DNA phylogeny. Subsequent to the end of the long-standing dual nomenclature for fungi (Hawksworth et al. 2011, Wingfield et al. 2012) and the connection of different morphs to a single name (Rossman et al. 2015, R\u00e9blov\u00e1 et al. 2016), it became clear that a vehicle was required to ensure that these data could be easily and effectively published. This would be comparable to \u201cdata release papers\u201d published in other fields of science and biology (Miller et al. 2013, Vu et al. 2016). The New and Interesting Fungi series will link not only asexual and sexual morphs of species, but also provide opportunities to merge morphological observations with DNA sequence data, providing a means for rapid and accurate identification. New and Interesting Fungi will appear twice each year (June and December) in the journal Fungal Systematics and Evolution (www.FUSE-journal.org). Mycologists and other researchers wishing to contribute to future issues in this series are encouraged to contact Pedro Crous (p.crous@westerdijkinstitute.nl) before submission to ensure that potential conflicts with activities arising from other research groups can be avoided. MATERIALS AND METHODS Isolates Leaves and twig samples were placed in damp chambers and incubated at room temperature for 1\u20133 d. Single conidial colonies were grown from sporulating conidiomata in Petri dishes containing 2 % malt extract agar (MEA) as described earlier by Crous et al. (1991). Leaf and stem tissues bearing ascomata were soaked in water for approximately 2 h, after which they were attached to the bottom side of the lids of Petri dishes containing MEA. After ascospores ejected onto the MEA, germination patterns were determined after 24 h, and single ascospore or conidial cultures were established following the method described by (Crous 1998). Colonies were sub-cultured on 2 % potato-dextrose agar (PDA), oatmeal agar (OA), MEA (Crous et al. 2009b), autoclaved pine needles on 2 % tap water agar (PNA) (Smith et al. 1996), or autoclaved banana leaves (BLA), and incubated at 25 \u00b0C under continuous near-ultraviolet light to promote sporulation. Reference strains and specimens are maintained at the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute in Utrecht, the Netherlands (CBS). DNA extraction, amplification (PCR) and phylogeny Fungal mycelium (Supplementary Table 1) was scraped from the agar surface of cultures with a sterile scalpel and the genomic DNA was isolated using the Wizard\u00ae Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega Corporation, WI, USA) following the manufacturers\u2019 protocols. The 28S nrRNA gene (LSU) and internal transcribed spacer regions with intervening 5.8S nrRNA gene (ITS) of the nrDNA operon were sequenced for all the isolates included in this study. Other loci were sequenced for various species or genera using primers and conditions specific for those groups of fungi (see REFERENCES for details). The resulting fragments were sequenced in both directions using the respective PCR primers and the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit v. 3.1 (Applied Biosystems Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA); DNA sequencing amplicons were purified through Sephadex G-50 Superfine columns (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in MultiScreen HV plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Purified sequence reactions were analysed on an Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The DNA sequences were analysed and consensus sequences were computed using SeqMan Pro v. 13 (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA). The sequences for each gene were subjected to megablast searches (Zhang et al. 2000) to identify closely related sequences in the NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database. The results are provided as part of the species notes or as selected phylogenetic trees. Phylogenetic trees were generated using Bayesian analyses performed with MrBayes v. 3.2.6 (Ronquist et al. 2012) for the overview trees and Maximum Parsimony analyses performed with PAUP v. 4.0b10 (Swofford 2003) as explained in Braun et al. (2018) for the genus and species trees. All resulting trees were printed with Geneious v. 11.0.3 (http://www.geneious.com, Kearse et al. 2012) and the layout of the trees was done in Adobe Illustrator v. CC 2017. Statistical measures calculated included tree length (TL), consistency index (CI), retention index (RI) and rescaled consistency index (RC). Morphology Slide preparations were mounted in lactic acid, Shear\u2019s mounting fluid or water, from colonies sporulating on MEA, PDA, PNA, BLA or OA. Sections through conidiomata were made by hand. Observations were made with a Nikon SMZ25 dissection-microscope, and with a Zeiss Axio Imager 2 light microscope using differential interference contrast (DIC) illumination and images recorded on a Nikon DS-Ri2 camera with associated software. Colony characters and pigment production were noted after 2\u20134 wk of growth on MEA, PDA and OA (Crous et al. 2009b) incubated at 25 \u00b0C. Colony colours (surface and reverse) were scored using the colour charts of Rayner (1970). Sequences derived in this study were deposited in GenBank (Supplementary Table 1), the alignment in TreeBASE (www.treebase.org; study number S22442), and taxonomic novelties in MycoBank (www.MycoBank.org; Crous et al. 2004). RESULTS Phylogeny Dothideomycetes LSU phylogeny: The alignment contained 125 isolates and Candida broadrunensis (CBS 11838, GenBank KY106372.1) was used as outgroup. The final alignment contained a total of 808 characters used for the phylogenetic analyses, including alignment gaps. Based on the results of MrModelTest, dirichlet base frequencies and the GTR+I+G model was used for the Bayesian analysis. The Bayesian analyses generated 38 302 trees from which 28 728 were sampled after 25 % of the trees were discarded as burn-in. The posterior probability values (PP) were calculated from the 28 728 trees (Fig. 1 overview Dothideomycetes; PP >0.74 shown). The alignment contained a total of 345 unique site patterns. Eurotiomycetes and Leotiomycetes LSU phylogeny: The alignment contained 44 isolates and Orbilia vinosa (GenBank DQ470952.1) was used as outgroup. The final alignment contained a total of 813 characters used for the phylogenetic analyses, including alignment gaps. Based on the results of MrModelTest, dirichlet base frequencies and the GTR+I+G model was used for the Bayesian analyses. The Bayesian analyses generated 9 702 trees from which 7 278 were sampled after 25 % of the trees were discarded as burn-in. The posterior probability values (PP) were calculated from the 7 278 trees (Fig. 2 overview Eurotiomycetes; PP >0.74 shown). The alignment contained a total of 253 unique site patterns. Sordariomycetes LSU phylogeny: The alignment contained 148 isolates and Candida broadrunensis (CBS 11838, GenBank KY106372.1) was used as outgroup. The final alignment contained a total of 761 characters used for the phylogenetic analyses, including alignment gaps. Based on the results of MrModelTest, dirichlet base frequencies and the GTR+I+G model was used for the Bayesian analysis. The Bayesian analyses generated 34 702 trees from which 26 028 were sampled after 25 % of the trees were discarded as burn-in. The posterior probability values (PP) were calculated from the 26 028 trees (Fig. 3 overview Sordariomycetes; first value: PP >0.74 shown). The alignment contained a total of 361 unique site patterns. Species phylogenies: Specific phylogenetic analyses were run for selected species and the resulting phylogenies are discussed in the species notes where applicable. Statistics associated with those phylogenies are provided in the figure legends. Taxonomy Alfaria acaciae Crous & M.J. Wingf., sp. nov. MycoBank MB824766. Fig. 4. Etymology: Name refers to Acacia, the genus of the substrate from which this fungus was collected. Conidiomata sporodochial, surrounded by setae, black with dark green to black slimy conidial masses, 80\u2013250 \u03bcm diam. Setae flexuous, unbranched, thick-walled, apex obtuse, dark brown, verruculose, 3\u20136-septate, 100\u2013150 \u00d7 5\u20137 \u03bcm. Conidiophores densely aggregated, arising from hyaline basal stroma, becoming pigmented and verruculose towards conidiogenous region, subcylindrical, 3\u20135-septate, branched, 30\u201355 \u00d7 2\u20132.5 \u03bcm. Conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal and intercalary, subcylindrical, becoming pigmented and verruculose at upper region, phialidic with periclinal thickening and flared collarette, 10\u201320 \u00d7 2\u20132.5 \u03bcm.

Culture characteristics: Colonies flat, spreading, with sparse aerial mycelium and smooth, lobate margins, reaching 50 mm diam after 2 wk at 25 \u00b0C. On MEA surface dirty white to pale luteous, reverse luteous. On PDA surface dirty white, reverse pale luteous. On OA surface pale luteous. Specimens examined: South Africa, Western Cape Province, Stellenbosch, Helshoogte Pass, on leaves of Acacia propinqua (Fabaceae), Jul. 2012, M.J. Wingfield (holotype CBS H-23428, culture ex-type CPC 31882 = CBS 143504); ibid., CPC 31940. Notes: Alfaria cyperi-esculenti was originally described from Cyperus esculentus in Spain, where it causes a serious foliar disease (Crous et al. 2014). This species is currently known only from its sexual morph, which complicates a morphological comparison with the present, asexual isolate from South Africa. Although phylogenetically closely related (Fig. 5), we regard them as two distinct species (see bp differences below). Furthermore, culture characteristics also differ between the two species, with cultures of A. acaciae growing faster, and paler in colour than the ochreous / apricot cultures of A. cyperi-esculenti (Crous et al. 2014). Based on a megablast search using the ITS sequence, the closest matches in NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database were A. cyperi-esculenti (GenBank KJ869143; Identities 567 / 577 (98 %), 5 gaps (0 %)), Myrothecium leucotrichum (GenBank AJ301992; Identities 566 / 578 (98 %), 7 gaps (1 %)) and A. thymi (GenBank KU845990; Identities 559 / 572 (98 %), 8 gaps (1 %)). The ITS sequences of CPC 31882 and 31940 are identical.

The rpb2 sequences of CPC 31882 and 31940 were identical. The highest similarities using the tef1 sequence of CPC 31882 were A. terrestris (GenBank KU846010; Identities 321 / 378 (85 %), 26 gaps (6 %)), A. caricicola (GenBank KU846008; Identities 370 / 441 (84 %), 20 gaps (4 %)) and A. ossiformis (GenBank KU846009; Identities 313 / 373 (84 %), 27 gaps (7 %)). The tef1 sequences of CPC 31882 and 31940 were identical. The highest similarities using the tub2 sequence of CPC 31882 were A. terrestris (GenBank KU846019; Identities 331 / 348 (95 %), 3 gaps (0 %)), A. putrefolia (GenBank KU846017; Identities 330 / 347 (95 %), 1 gap (0 %)) and A. ossiformis (GenBank KU846015; Identities 328 / 348 (94 %), 3 gaps (0 %)). Caliciopsis maxima (Berk. & M.A. Curtis) H\u00f6hn., Sitzungsber Akad. Wiss. Wien, Math.-Naturwiss. Kl., Abt. 1, 128: 84. 1919. Fig. 6. Basionym: Capnodium maximum Berk. & M.A. Curtis, J. Linn. Soc., Bot. 10(46): 391. 1868 (1869). Stromata mostly abaxial, limited to sporangial sori of ferns, hidden from view beneath the host sporangia until black ascigerous, bristle-like stromatic columnar tubes push up and protrude from the sori, or otherwise are produced on wounded tissues, sometimes bordering entire pinnules; not associated with discoloration or necrosis of the opposite surface of the frond; rarely adaxial; starting as minute, erumpent cushions, increasing in diameter and thickness after emergence. Ascigerous columns long-stalked, prominently beaked, undergoing repeated apical proliferation; additional stromatic column material is formed in a renewed vegetative growth phase at the funnel-shaped apex of each stalk; the process is repeated as many as five times; primary column usually longer, reaching up to 1.7 mm long, all columns formed later, not exceeding 700 \u03bcm in length; stalk long, slender, flexuous, 35\u201350 \u03bcm diam, covered with brown hyphae. Ascigenous swelling (locules) subterminal, ellipsoid, 125\u2013150 \u03bcm diam, 200\u2013350 \u03bcm in length, apical dehiscence, forming a reddish brown pulverulent of terminally aggregated ascospores. Asci bitunicate, evanescent, obclavate, pedicellate, straight or slightly curved, 15\u201317 \u00d7 8\u201310 \u03bcm, 8-spored, aparaphysate, hyaline, smooth. Ascospores inordinate, overlapping, globose or subglobose, 3\u20134 \u03bcm diam, aseptate, eguttulate, yellowish brown, thin-walled, smooth. Spermogonium subglobose, sessile or short stipitate, papillate, often covered in pale brown hyphae, aggregated below ascomatal tubes, black, smooth. Spermatia unicellular, narrowly fusiform, 11\u201324 \u00d7 3\u20134 \u03bcm, hyaline, smooth. Culture characteristics: Colonies on PCA slow-growing, 15\u201320 mm diam after 1 mo; irregular, convex with papillate surface, edges entire, aerial mycelium sparse to absent, composed of black hyphal tufts, vinaceous buff towards periphery, pigmenting the medium with cinnamon taint; sepia in reverse; colonies sterile. Specimens examined: Cuba, on fronds of Niphidium sp. (Polypodiaceae) (originally identified as Polypodium sp.), 1941, Wright (holotype CUP-029913). Brazil, Rio de Janeiro, Nova Friburgo, on fronds of Niphidium crassifolium (Polypodiaceae), 5 Nov. 2011, R.W. Barreto (epitype designated here VIC 42568, MBT373013, culture ex-epitype COAD 1983 = CPC 24674); ibid, on fronds of Microgramma squamulosa (Polypodiaceae), 10 Oct. 2013, R.W. Barreto (VIC 42602). Notes: The epitype specimen of Caliciopsis maxima (Coryneliaceae) proposed here closely matches the morphology of the holotype and several additional collections studied by Fitzpatrick (1942), including one recorded on the same host and location in Brazil (NY-02928724). On all materials, stromata were produced on sori of sporangia, or on wounded tissues, not associated with discoloration or tissue necrosis of the opposite surface of the frond. Ascigerous columns had a tendency to undergo repeated apical proliferation, a feature that differs from all other known species; ascospores are typically globose or subglobose, yellowish brown, 3\u20134 \u03bcm diam (Fitzpatrick 1942). Based on phylogenetic evidence, the genus resides in the Coryneliaceae, within the Eurotiomycetes, as recently demonstrated through molecular analysis (Prieto et al. 2013, Garrido-Benavent & P\u00e9rez-Ortega 2015, Wood et al. 2016). In the combined ITS-LSU analysis (Fig. 7), C. maxima clustered in a basal position, suggesting that the fungal species associated with ferns are evolutionarily basal to the evolution of their relatives, as previously demonstrated for the cercosporoid and mycosphaerella-like species occurring on ferns (Guatimosim et al. 2016). Based on a megablast search using the ITS sequence, the closest matches in NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database were Corynelia uberata (GenBank KU204606; Identities 474 / 544 (87 %), 21 gaps (3 %)), Caliciopsis pinea (GenBank KY099604; Identities 323 / 361 (89 %), 6 gaps (1 %)) and C. beckhausii (GenBank NR_132090; Identities 330 / 370 (89 %), 11 gaps (2 %)). The highest similarities using the LSU sequence were C. nigra (GenBank KP144011; Identities 771 / 825 (93 %), 5 gaps (0 %)), C. pinea (GenBank DQ678097; Identities 779 / 839 (93 %), 6 gaps (0 %)) and C. valentina (GenBank KP144013; Identities 780 / 842 (93 %), 6 gaps (0 %)).

Specimens examined: Finland, Outokumpu, on twig of Caragana sp. (Fabaceae), 31 Dec. 2014, M. Pennanen, specimen CBS H-23430, culture CPC 25960 = CBS 144200; ibid., CPC 25962. Notes: Isolates CPC 25960 and CPC 25962 were treated as \u201cCamarosporium sp. 2\u201d in Crous & Groenewald (2017). The species was subsequently placed in the genus Camarosporidiella by Wanasinghe et al. (2017), clustering within the C. mackenziei clade. The latter taxon was described from twigs of Caragana arborescens collected in Russia. Although the present collection produced only the microconidial morph in culture, the sexual morph was observed on host tissue, which is a new observation for this species.

Crous (holotype CBS H-23432, culture ex-type CPC 30166 = CBS 143496); ibid., CPC 30168. Notes: Sexual morph not observed, but ascospores harvested from plant material, indicating that a sexual morph exists. Colletotrichum kniphofiae was isolated from dead leaves of Kniphofia, and nothing is known regarding its ecology, and no species of Colletotrichum have been described from this host. Supported by its distinct DNA phylogeny (Fig. 11), we believe this collection represents a distinct species. Based on a megablast search using the ITS sequence of CPC 30166, the closest matches in NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database were Co. godetiae (GenBank KX756147; Identities 567 / 575 (99 %), 2 gaps (0 %)), Co. pyricola (GenBank KU963516; Identities 565 / 575 (95 %), 2 gaps (0 %)) and Co. salicis (GenBank KU498278; Identities 565 / 575 (95 %), 2 gaps (0 %)). The ITS sequences of CPC 30166 and CPC 30168 are identical. The highest similarities using the LSU sequence of CPC 30166 were Co. godetiae (GenBank KU973721; Identities 837 / 839 (99 %), no gaps), Co. acutatum (GenBank JN939926; Identities 837 / 839 (99 %), no gaps) and Co. fioriniae (GenBank JN939914; Identities 837 / 839 (99 %), no gaps). The highest similarities using the actA sequence were Co. destructivum (GenBank AY157843; Identities 596 / 657 (91 %), 16 gaps (2 %)), Co. kahawae (GenBank KU579251; Identities 595 / 659 (90 %), 26 gaps (3 %)) and Co. orbiculare (GenBank AB778553; Identities 584 / 654 (89 %), 22 gaps (3 %)). The highest similarities using the chs1 sequence were Co. salicis (GenBank JQ949131; Identities 245 / 252 (97 %), no gaps), Co. godetiae (GenBank KY171916; Identities 244 / 252 (97 %), no gaps) and Co. rhombiforme (GenBank JQ949118; Identities 243 / 252 (97 %), no gaps).

Culture characteristics: Colonies spreading, flat on OA, erumpent on MEA and PDA, with moderate aerial mycelium and feathery margins, reaching 35 mm diam after 2 wk at 25 \u00b0C. On MEA surface dirty white, reverse apricot, on OA surface pale violet, on PDA surface coral with flesh in outer region, reverse sienna with patches of umber. Specimen examined: Germany, near Berlin, on twig of Ailanthus altissima (Simaroubaceae), 4 Jun. 2015, R.K. Schumacher (specimen CBS H-23423, culture CPC 27604 = CBS 144201). Notes: The genus Cyclothyriella was recently introduced by Jaklitsch & Voglmayr (2016), who also treated the taxonomic history of this genus in detail. The asexual morph isolated in this study closely resembles that described and illustrated by Jaklitsch & Voglmayr (2016), who reported conidia as (2\u2013)4.5\u20136(\u20136.5) \u00d7 (2\u2013) 2.7\u20133.5(\u20134) \u03bcm, \u04ffrst hyaline, becoming medium brown with age. This fungus is common in Europe, and here we present a culture from Germany to supplement the Austrian material studied by Jaklitsch & Voglmayr (2016). Based on a megablast search using the ITS sequence, the closest matches in NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database were Cyclothyriella rubronotata (GenBank NR_147651; Identities 564 / 564 (100 %), no gaps), Melanomma pulvis-pyrius (GenBank KY189979; Identities 400 / 476 (84 %), 20 gaps (4 %)) and Ascochyta medicaginicola (GenBank KX381183; Identities 359 / 419 (86 %), 10 gaps (2 %)). The highest similarities using the LSU sequence were Cy. rubronotata (GenBank KX650541; Identities 833 / 833 (100 %), no gaps), Thyridaria rubronotata (GenBank JX681121; Identities 833 / 833 (100 %), no gaps) and Neooccultibambusa jonesii (GenBank KY111437; Identities 781 / 812 (96 %), 2 gaps (0 %)). Cylindriaceae Crous & L. Lombard, fam. nov. MycoBank MB824770.Mycelium consisting of hyaline, smooth, septate, branched, hyphae. Conidiophores aggregated in sporodochia, or solitary, erect; hyphae and basal part of conidiophores becoming pale brown, smooth, subcylindrical, erect, septate, branched. Conidiogenous cells terminal and intercalary, subcylindrical, hyaline, smooth, with several sympodial flat-tipped loci, unthickened, not darkened. Ramoconidia hyaline, smooth, guttulate, subcylindrical. Conidia aseptate, hyaline, smooth, arranged in long, branched chains, scars unthickened, slightly refractive. Type genus: Cylindrium Bonord.Note: The genus Cylindrium, based on C. elongatum, was regarded by Lombard et al. (2015) as incertae sedis, and thus Cylindriaceae is herewith introduced to accommodate this genus. Cylindrium algarvense (Cheew. & Crous) Crous, comb. nov. MycoBank MB824771.Basionym: Polyscytalum algarvense Cheew. & Crous, Persoonia 23: 73. 2009. Description and illustration: Cheewangkoon et al. (2009). Specimen examined: Portugal, Faro, Algarve, on Eucalyptus sp. (Myrtaceae), 24 Jan. 2007, P.W. Crous (holotype CBS H-20289, culture ex-type CPC 14936 = CBS 124770); ibid. (CPC 14937, CPC 14938).

Description and illustration: Crous et al. (2016a). Specimen examined: USA, Texas, Austin, on leaf litter, Aug. 2013, P.W. Crous (holotype CBS H-22899, culture ex-type CPC 29580 = CBS 142114). Note: See discussion under Polyscytalum and Fig. 13. Cylindrium syzygii (Crous & R.G. Shivas) Crous, comb. nov. MycoBank MB824773.Basionym: Pseudoidriella syzygii Crous & R.G. Shivas, Persoonia 27: 135. 2011. Description and illustration: Crous et al. (2011). Specimen examined: Australia, Queensland, Mackay, Eungella National Park, on leaves of Syzygium sp. (Myrtaceae), 14 Jul. 2009, P.W. Crous & K.L. Crous, (holotype CBS H-20758, cultures ex-type CPC 17233 = CBS 131307). Note: See discussion under Polyscytalum and Fig. 13. By placing Pseudoidriella syzygii in Cylindrium, the genus Pseudoidriella is also reduced to synonymy with Cylindrium. This suggests that the conidiomata of Cylindrium could be reduced to solitary conidiophores, as well as sporodochia, as observed in this species. Interestingly enough, an LSU sequence attributed to Tristratiperidium microsporum also clustered in this clade (Fig. 3), which completely disagrees with the morphology of this fungus. This suggests that this sequence (MFLUCC) should be reconsidered. The ITS sequence from the same culture placed Tristratiperidium microsporum with Kirstenboschia diospyri (Fig. 13). Cytospora viticola D.P. Lawr. et al., Pl. Pathol. 66: 718. 2017. Fig. 14. Conidiomata (on PDA) with stromata up to 500 \u03bcm diam, rosette cytosporoid, subdivided by invaginations, up to four radially arranged. Conidiophores hyaline, smooth, branched, 1\u20133-septate, 15\u201320 \u00d7 2\u20133 \u03bcm, immersed in a mucilaginous layer.

Culture characteristics: Colonies spreading, with sparse aerial mycelium and smooth, lobate margins, covering dish after 1 mo at 25 \u00b0C. On MEA surface isabelline, reverse brown vinaceous. On PDA surface and reverse. On OA surface sepia. Specimen examined: Hungary, P\u00e9cs wine region, on stems of Vitis vinifera (Vitaceae), 5 Nov. 2014, K.Z. V\u00e1czy (specimen CBS H-23278, culture T15 / 464 = CPC 30117 = CBS 143162). Notes: Species of Cytospora are commonly known from woody plants and generally have wide host ranges. Two Cytospora species, C. vinacea and C. viticola, causing dieback and cankers of grapevines in the USA were recently described (Lawrence et al. 2017). Other species known from Vitis include C. ceratosperma (CBS 397.36), as well as the European taxa C. vitis and Valsa vitis, which are insufficiently known, and for which we could not trace type material. The isolate described here was associated with cankers on grapevines in Hungary, and is similar to C. viticola. Based on a megablast search using the ITS sequence, the closest matches in NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database were Cy. sibiraeae (GenBank KR045651; Identities 566 / 591 (96 %), 8 gaps (1 %)), Cy. chrysosperma (GenBank KT692596; Identities 568 / 594 (96 %), 7 gaps (1 %)) and Cy. germanica (GenBank KX168596; Identities 563 / 590 (95 %), 7 gaps (1 %)). Our ITS sequence is identical to Cy. viticola (GenBank KX256239; Identities 423 / 423 (100 %), no gaps), but was not a result in the megablast search as roughly half of the first internal spacer region sequence is missing for the deposited sequences of that species. The highest similarities using the LSU sequence were Valsa mali (GenBank AF362559; Identities 837 / 842 (99 %), 1 gap (0 %)), Cy. centrivillosa (GenBank MF190068; Identities 830 / 837 (99 %), 1 gap (0 %)) and Cy. ambiens (GenBank EU255208; Identities 772 / 779 (99 %), no gaps).

Notes: Dictyochaeta mimusopis is closely allied to isolates in the Di. simplex complex (conidia 14\u201319 \u00d7 2.1\u20132.7 \u03bcm; Hughes & Kendrick 1968). Based on a megablast search using the ITS sequence, the closest matches in NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database were Di. simplex (GenBank EF029193; Identities 482 / 503 (96 %), 1 gap (0 %)), Di. fertilis (GenBank AF178540; Identities 469 / 491 (96 %), 5 gaps (1 %)) and Codinaea pini (GenBank NR_137943; Identities 485 / 521 (93 %), 22 gaps (4 %)). The highest similarities using the LSU sequence were Di. simplex (GenBank AF178559; Identities 830 / 836 (99 %), no gaps), Codinaea pini (GenBank KP004493; Identities 829 / 838 (99 %), 1 gap (0 %)) and Rattania setulifera (GenBank HM171322; Identities 815 / 835 (98 %), no gaps).

Specimens examined: Brazil, Espirito Santo, Vania, on Eucalyptus sp. (Myrtaceae), 11 Dec. 1973, C.S. Hodges (holotype K(M) IMI 181532f). Chile, on leaves of Eucalyptus grandis \u00d7 urophylla (Myrtaceae), Jun. 2010, M.J. Wingfield (epitype of Codinaea septata designated here CBS H-23427, MBT381137, culture ex-epitype CPC 31949 = CBS 143386). Notes: This collection closely resembles Codinaea septata, described from Eucalyptus leaves in Brazil with its conidia being 1(\u20132)-septate, (14.5\u2013)17.5\u201323 \u00d7 2 \u03bcm, and conidiophores 30\u2013105 \u00d7 4\u20136 \u03bcm (Sutton & Hodges 1975). Although we have in recent papers treated the genera Codinaea (setulate conidia) as distinct from Dictyochaeta (asetulate conidia) (Crous et al. 2015b), it appears that they could very well represent a single genus, with preference given to the older name, Dictyochaeta. Based on a megablast search using the ITS sequence, the closest matches in NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database were Pseudolachnella guaviyunis (GenBank KJ834524; Identities 480 / 542 (89 %), 13 gaps (2 %)), Di. simplex (GenBank EF029193; Identities 462 / 519 (89 %), 9 gaps (1 %)) and Thozetella fabacearum (GenBank KY212754; Identities 478 / 544 (88 %), 27 gaps (4 %)).

Specimen examined: Malaysia, on leaves of Acacia crassicarpa (Fabaceae), 1 Jul. 2015, M.J. Wingfield (specimen CBS H-23424, culture CPC 28754 = CBS 144202). Notes: Echinocatena arthrinioides was originally described from leaf litter collected in India. This collection has conidia that are slightly larger those observed for the type collection (3.5\u20134.5 \u03bcm; Campbell & Sutton 1977), and DNA data would be required to fully resolve if this strain is conspecific with the type (IMI 199279). Based on a megablast search using the ITS sequence, the closest matches in NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database were \u201cFusicladium sp.\u201d from marine sponges in Panama (GenBank JN837045; Identities 524 / 530 (99 %), no gaps) and \u201cSympoventuriaceae sp.\u201d from a human nail in Hong Kong (GenBank LC158598; Identities 448 / 452 (99 %), no gaps); the remaining matches were with the 5.8S nrRNA genes of Fusicladium species. The highest similarities using the LSU sequence were Mycosisymbrium cirrhosum (GenBank KR259884; Identities 758 / 828 (92 %), 9 gaps (1 %)), Scolecobasidium cateniphorum (GenBank EU107309; Identities 758 / 829 (91 %), 11 gaps (1 %)) and Verruconis verruculosa (GenBank KF282668; Identities 757 / 829 (91 %), 11 gaps (1 %)).

Barreto, specimen CBS H-22804, culture CPC 18518 = RWB 224 = CBS 141943. Notes: The epitype was designated in Fan et al. (2017), but that epitypification was not effected since the holotype was not \u201cexplicitly\u201d cited (Art 9.8, Melbourne Code). We correct this situation by citing the holotype as \u201cIAC No. 2836\u201d. Exophiala eucalypticola Crous & T.I. Burgess, sp. nov. MycoBank MB824775. Fig. 18.

Crous (holotype CBS H-23305, cultures ex-type CPC 32736 = CBS 143412). Notes: The genera Exophiala and Rhinocladiella contain several clinically relevant species (de Hoog 1977). Based on a megablast search using the ITS sequence, the closest matches in NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database were R. aquaspersa (GenBank AB091214; Identities 458 / 519 (88 %), 18 gaps (3 %)), E. phaeomuriformis (GenBank KP761151; Identities 485 / 555 (87 %), 27 gaps (4 %)) and R. coryli (GenBank KX306768; Identities 518 / 594 (87 %), 25 gaps (4 %)). The highest similarities using the LSU sequence were E. xenobiotica (GenBank KC311483; Identities 831 / 862 (96 %), 7 gaps (0 %)), E. xenobiotica (GenBank FJ358246; Identities 826 / 857 (96 %), 7 gaps (0 %)) and Melanoctona tectonae (GenBank KX258779; Identities 828 / 860 (96 %), 6 gaps (0 %)). The present collection is best allocated to this generic complex, and until better resolved it is best placed in Exophiala. No significant hits were obtained when the tef1 and tub2 sequences were used in a megablast search. Fusiconidium lycopodiellae Crous & R.K. Schumach., sp. nov. MycoBank MB824776. Fig. 19. Etymology: Name refers to Lycopodiella, the host genus from which this fungus was collected. Mycelium consisting of hyaline, smooth, branched, septate, 2.5\u20134 \u03bcm diam hyphae. Hyphopodia absent. Conidiophores solitary, erect, subcylindrical, geniculate-sinuous, brown, smooth, 1\u20132-septate, 20\u201350 \u00d7 3\u20135 \u03bcm. Conidiogenous cells terminal, subcylindrical, brown, smooth, 10\u201317 \u00d7 3\u20134 \u03bcm, proliferating sympodially, holoblastically; scars unthickened, undarkened, 2\u20133 \u03bcm diam. Conidia solitary, brown, smooth, granular, subcylindrical, apex obtuse, tapering in lower cell to truncate hilum, 2\u20133 \u03bcm diam, (7\u2013)8\u20139(\u201311)-septate, (65\u2013)75\u201385(\u2013100) \u00d7 (7\u2013)8(\u20139) \u03bcm. Culture characteristics: Colonies flat, spreading, with sparse aerial mycelium and smooth, lobate margins, covering dish after 1 mo at 25 \u00b0C. On MEA surface ochreous, reverse amber. On PDA surface and reverse amber. On OA surface luteous. Specimen examined: Germany, near Berlin, on stems of Lycopodiella inundata (Lycopodiaceae), 25 Feb. 2016, R.K. Schumacher (holotype CBS H-23407, culture ex-type CPC 30371 = CBS 143437). Notes: The present collection is reminiscent of Clasterosporium, except that it lacks hyphopodia (Ellis 1971). Based on LSU sequence data it is allied to Fusiconidium (Li et al. 2017), except that it lacks percurrent proliferation of the conidiogenous cells, and fusoid to ellipsoid conidia, and probably represents a new genus in this complex. However, due to the poor sporulation of the culture, we have tentatively named it in Fusiconidium. Based on a megablast search using the ITS sequence, the closest matches in NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database were Camposporium cambrense (GenBank KY853428; Identities 481 / 502 (96 %), 3 gaps (0 %)), Phragmocephala atra (GenBank KP698721; Identities 495 / 523 (95 %), 4 gaps (0 %)) and Phragmocephala garethjonesii (GenBank NR_147636; Identities 493 / 523 (94 %), 3 gaps (0 %)). The highest similarities using the LSU sequence were Fusiconidium mackenziei (GenBank KX611113; Identities 806 / 815 (99 %), no gaps), Paradendryphiella salina (GenBank KF156156; Identities 780 / 791 (99 %), no gaps) and Aposphaeria corallinolutea (GenBank KU243051; Identities 804 / 817 (98 %), no gaps). Haplographium delicatum Berk. & Broome, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., Ser. 3, 3(17): 361. 1859. Fig. 20. Conidiophores erect, subcylindrical, straight to flexuous, brown, thick-walled, verruculose, base with T-cell, lacking rhizoids, 70\u2013160 \u00d7 5\u20136 \u03bcm, 5\u201310-septate. Conidiophores with swollen apical cell, pale brown, giving rise to 3\u20136 apical conidiogenous cells or primary branches; primary branches subcylindrical, straight to allantoid, hyaline, smooth, 5\u201310 \u00d7 2.5\u20133 \u03bcm. Conidiogenous cells hyaline, smooth, subcylindrical, straight to slightly curved, 6\u201312 \u00d7 2\u20132.5 \u03bcm, proliferating sympodially at apex. Conidia aggregating in mucoid mass, hyaline, smooth, guttulate, subcylindrical, straight, apex slightly swollen, obtuse, base truncate, (3\u2013)5\u20136(\u20137.5) \u00d7 2(\u20132.5) \u03bcm. Culture characteristics: Colonies flat, spreading, with sparse aerial mycelium and smooth, lobate margins, reaching 13 mm diam after 2 wk at 25 \u00b0C. On MEA surface and reverse pale luteous. On PDA surface pale olivaceous grey, reverse ochreous. On OA surface umber, with diffuse sienna pigment. Specimen examined: Ukraine, Ternopil region, Zalischyky district, Dniester Canyon, on decaying wood of Carpinus betulus (Betulaceae), 5 Oct. 2016, A. Akulov, specimen ex CWU (MYC) AS 6049 (dried culture CBS H-23417, culture CPC 31844 = CBS 143493). Notes: The genus Haplographium is based on H. delicatum described from wood collected in Britain. The present collection is phylogenetically similar to strains identified as H. catenatum and H. delicatum (Crous et al. 2009a). Because the genus Haplographium lacks a type and the species concepts are still in flux, we have identified the present collection as H. delicatum. Species of Haplographium have been linked to Dematioscypha sexual morphs (Raitviir 2001), but this relationship also requires further study. Based on a megablast search using the ITS sequence, the closest matches in NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database were H. catenatum (GenBank FJ839620; Identities 528 / 533 (99 %), 1 gap (0 %)), H. delicatum (GenBank HF677177; Identities 495 / 500 (99 %), 1 gap (0 %)) and Ciliciopodium brevipes (GenBank KM231856; Identities 401 / 451 (89 %), 10 gaps (2 %)). The highest similarities using the LSU sequence were H. catenatum (GenBank FJ839657; Identities 855 / 855 (100 %), no gaps), Hyaloscypha minuta (GenBank KY769526; Identities 832 / 857 (97 %), 3 gaps (0 %)) and Hy. monodictys (GenBank JN086756; Identities 808 / 833 (97 %), 3 gaps (0 %)). Microdochium musae (T.Y. Lin & J.M. Yen) Crous, comb. nov. MycoBank MB824777. Fig. 21.Basionym: Sphaerulina musae T.Y. Lin & J.M. Yen, Rev. Mycol. (Paris) 35: 326. 1971. Ascomata (on OA) solitary, immersed on leaf tissue (superficial to immersed on banana leaf agar), globose, semi-papillate with central ostiole, pale brown, 200\u2013250 \u03bcm diam; wall of 6\u20138 layers of pale brown textura angularis. Paraphyses intermingled among asci, hyaline smooth, septate, unbranched, constricted at septa, hyphae-like, 4\u20135 \u03bcm diam, with obtuse ends. Asci fasciculate, hyaline, unitunicate, apical mechanism staining blue in Meltzer\u2019s, broadly ellipsoid, straight to curved, 8-spored, stipitate, 80\u2013100 \u00d7 17\u201322 \u03bcm. Ascospores bi- to triseriate, hyaline to faintly pinkish, smooth, guttulate, obovoid, apex obtuse, tapering from middle to base, straight to curved, 3\u20136-septate, at times with mucoid sheath, frequently constricted at median septum, (30\u2013) 32\u201333(\u201335) \u00d7 (6\u2013)7(\u20138) \u03bcm. Culture characteristics: Colonies flat, spreading, with sparse aerial mycelium, radially folded, and even margins, reaching 40 mm diam after 2 wk at 25 \u00b0C. On MEA surface and reverse saffron. On PDA surface and reverse salmon. On OA surface salmon. Specimens examined. Republic of China (Taiwan), on leaves of Musa sp. (Musaceae), 1970, T. Wang, holotype missing, lectotype designated here, MBT381229 (Lin & Yen 1971, fig. 2 D\u2013F). Malaysia, Sabah, on leaves of Musa sp., 2016, P.W. Crous (epitype designated here, CBS H-23431, MBT381140, culture ex-epitype CPC 32689 = CBS 143500). Additional cultures examined: Costa Rica, on Musa cv. Cavendish, May 2002, P.W. Crous (CBS 111018 = CPC 5380). Malaysia, on Musa leaves, 2010, P.W. Crous (CPC 32681), ibid. (CPC 32809). Mauritius, on Musa leaves, Jan. 2004, Y. Jaufeerally-Fakim (CPC 11234), ibid. (CPC 11240). Mexico, Chiapas, on Musa leaves, 16 Dec. 2008, M. de J. Yanez Morales (CPC 16258). Notes: The genus Sphaerulina was treated by Quaedvlieg et al. (2013), and represents a genus in the Mycosphaerellaceae, to which S. musae (Lin & Yen 1971) is not related. \u201cSphaerulina\u201d musae clusters among species of Microdochium, which have sexual morphs that are morphologically similar (Hern\u00e1ndez-Restrepo et al. 2016), justifying this new combination. Microdochium musae is commonly associated with brown necrotic areas on banana leaves, appears to be globally distributed along with its host, and is assumed to be weakly pathogenic (unpubl. data). Because the holotype could not be traced in Taiwan or Paris, the original illustration is proposed as lectotype and a neotype is designated. Colonies initially have a yeast-like appearance in culture, and single ascospores give rise to the sexual morph, suggesting that the species is homothallic. Based on a megablast search using the ITS sequence of CPC 32689, the closest matches in NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database were Sphaerulina musae (GenBank AY293061; Identities 477 / 477 (100 %), no gaps), Mi. stoveri (GenBank FJ430601; Identities 537 / 540 (99 %), no gaps) and Mi. colombiense (GenBank KP858999; Identities 499 / 516 (97 %), 3 gaps (0 %)). The highest similarities using the LSU sequence of CPC 32689, the closest matches in NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database were Mi. colombiense (GenBank KP858935; Identities 834 / 842 (99 %), no gaps), Mi. citrinidiscum (GenBank KP858939; Identities 831 / 842 (99 %), no gaps) and Mi. sorghi (GenBank KP858936; Identities 831 / 842 (99 %), no gaps). The highest similarities using the actA sequence of CPC 16258 were Chaetopsina fulva (GenBank KM231165; Identities 404 / 422 (96 %), no gaps), Fusarium phaseoli (GenBank KM231203; Identities 400 / 419 (95 %), no gaps) and Ch. acutispora (GenBank KM231164; Identities 401 / 421 (95 %), no gaps). The actA sequences of CPC 11234, 11240, 16258, 32681 and 32809 are identical, but differ with two nucleotides from CPC 32689. No significant hits were obtained when the cmdA sequences were used in a megablast search. The cmdA sequences of CPC 11234, 11240, 16258, 32689 and 32809 are identical, but differ one nucleotide from CPC 32681. The highest similarities using the rpb2 sequence of CPC 32689 were Mi. colombiense (GenBank KP859108; Identities 740 / 782 (95 %), no gaps), Mi. majus (GenBank KP859110; Identities 675 / 780 (87 %), 4 gaps (0 %)) and M. nivale (GenBank KP859117; Identities 679 / 785 (86 %), 6 gaps (0 %)). No significant hits were obtained when the tef1 and tub2 sequences of CPC 32681 were used in a megablast search. The tef1 sequences of CPC 11234, 11240, 16258 and 32689 are identical. The tub2 sequences of CPC 11234, 11240, 32689 and 32809 are identical, but differ one nucleotide from CPC 16258. Monochaetia junipericola Crous & R.K. Schumach., sp. nov. MycoBank MB824778. Fig. 22. Etymology: Name refers to Juniperus, the host genus from which this fungus was collected. Conidiomata pycnidioid, separate to gregarious, erumpent, ovoid, 150\u2013250 \u03bcm diam. Conidiophores arising from central stroma, hyaline, smooth, 3\u20136-septate, branched, subcylindrical, 40\u2013100 \u00d7 3\u20134 \u03bcm. Conidiogenous cells terminal and intercalary, hyaline, smooth, subcylindrical, 10\u201330 \u00d7 2.5\u20133 \u03bcm, proliferating percurrently at apex. Conidia fusoid-ellipsoid, 4-septate, not constricted at septa, medium brown, finely verruculose, end cells hyaline, (22\u2013)25\u201327(\u201328) \u00d7 (5\u2013)6(\u20137) \u03bcm, apical cell terminating in a single, unbranched, filiform, flexuous appendage, 10\u201320 \u03bcm long; basal cell with single, unbranched, flexuous, excentric appendage, 2\u201315 \u03bcm long. Conidiomata with beta conidia developing on OA, beta conidia hyaline, smooth, filiform, curved, apex obtuse, base truncate, 12\u201322 \u00d7 1.5\u20132 \u03bcm. Culture characteristics: Colonies flat, spreading, with moderate aerial mycelium and feathery, lobate margins, reaching 40 mm diam after 2 wk at 25 \u00b0C. On MEA surface pale luteous, reverse luteous. On PDA surface smoke grey with patches of isabelline, reverse pale luteous. On OA surface pale luteous with patches of amber. Specimen examined: Germany, near Berlin, on twig of Juniperus communis (Cypressaceae), 20 Apr. 2016, R.K. Schumacher (holotype CBS H-23408, culture ex-type CPC 30561 = CBS 143391). Notes: Nag Raj (1993) defined the genus Monochaetia to accommodate taxa with acervular conidiomata and fusiform, brown, transversely septate conidia with a single cellular apical, and single cellular basal appendage (when present). Nag Raj (1993) also regarded Mo. juniperi as synonym of Sarcostroma foliicola, occurring on needles of Juniperus communis. Morphologically S. foliicola has fusiform, 5-septate conidia, 18\u201322.5 \u00d7 7\u20138(\u20139) \u03bcm, apical appendage 3\u20138(\u20139) \u03bcm, and basal appendage excentric, 3\u201311 \u03bcm, thus smaller than those of M. junipericola. Phylogenetically, M. junipericola is basal to the other Monochaetia species known from ITS sequences (Fig. 23). Based on a megablast search using the ITS sequence, the closest matches in NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database were Mo. ilexae (GenBank NR_148179; Identities 497 / 516 (96 %), 7 gaps (1 %)), Mo. dimorphospora (GenBank LC146750; Identities 498 / 527 (94 %), 20 gaps (3 %)) and Synnemadiella eucalypti (GenBank KY173467; Identities 497 / 538 (92 %), 10 gaps (1 %)). The highest similarities using the LSU sequence were Mo. ilexae (GenBank KX984152; Identities 846 / 847 (99 %), no gaps), Mo. kansensis (GenBank DQ534035; Identities 832 / 833 (99 %), no gaps) and Mo. monochaeta (GenBank KF590148; Identities 828 / 829 (99 %), no gaps). Only distant hits were obtained using the rpb2 sequence; some of these were Pestalotiopsis versicolor (GenBank DQ368654; Identities 662 / 803 (82 %), 4 gaps (0 %)), P. fici (GenBank XM_007830789; Identities 657 / 800 (82 %), no gaps) and Discosia brasiliensis (GenBank KF827475; Identities 658 / 805 (82 %), 4 gaps (0 %)). No significant hits were obtained when the tef1 sequence was used in a megablast search. The best hit using the tub2 sequence was with Mo. kansensis (GenBank DQ534049; Identities 356 / 407 (87 %), 3 gaps (0 %)). Myrmecridium sorbicola Crous & R.K. Schumach., sp. nov. MycoBank MB824779. Fig. 24. Etymology: Name refers to Sorbus, the host genus from which this fungus was collected. On OA (only medium with sporulation). Mycelium consisting of hyaline, smooth, branched, septate, 2\u20133 \u03bcm diam hyphae. Conidiophores solitary, erect, flexuous, unbranched, brown, subcylindrical, smooth, 1\u201318-septate, 50\u2013200 \u00d7 4\u20137 \u03bcm. Conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal and intercalary, 20\u201365 \u00d7 3\u20134 \u03bcm, with a rachis of pimple-like denticles, 0.5\u20131 \u00d7 0.5 \u03bcm. Conidia solitary, obovoid, initially hyaline, but pale brown with age, apex obtuse, hilum 1 \u03bcm diam, (0\u2013)1(\u20133) septate, with mucoid sheath surrounding conidium in median region, 1\u20132 \u03bcm diam, (7\u2013)8\u201310(\u201315) \u00d7 4(\u20135) \u03bcm. Culture characteristics: Colonies flat, spreading, with sparse aerial mycelium and even, lobate margins, reaching 12 mm diam after 2 wk at 25 \u00b0C. On MEA surface and reverse luteous. On PDA surface and reverse pale luteous. On OA surface pale luteous. Specimen examined: Germany, near Berlin, on branch of Sorbus aucuparia (Rosaceae), 17 Feb. 2016, R.K. Schumacher (holotype CBS H-23405, culture ex-type CPC 30455 = CBS 143433). Notes: Myrmecridium was introduced by Arzanlou et al. (2007) for ramichloridium-like taxa having hyaline mycelium, and relatively unpigmented, pimple-like denticles, and obovoid to fusoid conidia with a wing-like gelatinous sheath. Myrmecridium sorbicola is distinct from known species based on its conidial morphology, with conidia being (0\u2013)1(\u20133)-septate, (7\u2013)8\u201310(\u201315) \u00d7 4(\u20135) \u03bcm. Based on a megablast search using the ITS sequence, the closest matches in NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database were My. schulzeri (GenBank KF986544; Identities 447 / 513 (87 %), 14 gaps (2 %)), My. phragmitis (GenBank NR_137782; Identities 494 / 567 (87 %), 18 gaps (3 %)) and My. fluviae (GenBank KX839679; Identities 419 / 481 (87 %), 15 gaps (3 %)). The highest similarities using the LSU sequence were My. banksiae (GenBank NG_042684; Identities 813 / 842 (97 %), 2 gaps (0 %)), My. schulzeri (GenBank EU041835; Identities 812 / 842 (96 %), 2 gaps (0 %)) and My. spartii (GenBank KR611902; Identities 812 / 843 (96 %), 3 gaps (0 %)). Nematogonum ferrugineum (Pers.) S. Hughes, Canad. J. Bot. 36: 789. 1958. Fig. 25. Basionym: Monilinia ferruginea Pers., Mycol. eur. (Erlanga) 1: 30. 1822. Mycelium consisting of hyaline, smooth, branched, septate, 3\u20134 \u03bcm diam hyphae. Conidiophores dimorphic. Microconidiophores reduced to conidiogenous cells on hyphae, erect, golden-brown, smooth, cylindrical, 20\u201340 \u00d7 6\u20138 \u03bcm. Macroconidiophores erect, flexuous, subcylindrical, smooth, golden-brown, flexuous, up to 400 \u03bcm tall, 8\u201310 \u03bcm diam, 2\u20137-septate, unbranched, terminal conidiogenous cell clavate, but at times also intercalary (appears to be linked to rejuvenating conidiophore), 25\u2013100 \u00d7 11\u201315 \u03bcm; loci sympodial, thickened, somewhat darkened, 1\u20132 \u03bcm diam. Conidia occurring in branched chains, obovoid to ellipsoid, thick-walled, golden-brown, smooth, granular, apex obtuse, tapering to a truncate hilum, thickened and somewhat darkened, 1\u20132 \u03bcm diam, attached via a narrow isthmus, aseptate; primary conidia 15\u201321 \u00d7 12\u201314 \u03bcm; secondary conidia 11\u201315 \u00d7 8\u20139 \u03bcm; tertiary conidia 7\u201310 \u00d7 6\u20137 \u03bcm. Culture characteristics: Colonies not growing on MEA, PDA or SNA. Colonies on OA pale luteous, flat, spreading, with sparse aerial mycelium and feathery, lobate margins, reaching 40 mm diam after 2 wk at 25 \u00b0C. Specimen examined: Ukraine, Ternopil region, Zalischyky district, Dniester Canyon, on ascomata of Melogramma campylosporum on trunk of fallen Carpinus betulus (Betulaceae), 7 Oct. 2016, A. Akulov, specimen ex CWU (MYC) AS 6079 (dried culture CBS H-23418, culture CPC 31872 = CBS 144203). Notes: Matsushima (1975) firstly reported an aspergillus-like synasexual morph for Nematogonum highlei (a synonym of N. ferrugineum). His description and illustrations correspond well with the conidiophores we observed in this study. Walker & Minter (1981) studied the conidiogenesis of N. ferrugineum and cited conidia to be ellipsoid, 4\u201324 \u00d7 3\u201315 \u03bcm, which become progressively smaller towards the tips of the chains. However, no distinction was made between primary, secondary or tertiary conidia. The general conidium dimensions observed here, 7\u201321 \u00d7 6\u201315 \u03bcm, in the collection are different from the original species description, but correspond well with those provided by Matsushima (1975), 7\u201322 \u00d7 6.5\u201315 \u03bcm. Nematogonum is not known from any sequence data that we were able to locate, and is listed as \u201cincertae sedis\u201d in MycoBank and Index Fungorum. In the present study, we were unable to generate an LSU sequence. However, based on a megablast search using the ITS sequence, the closest matches in NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database were Melanospora spp. (Melanosporales, Hypocreomycetidae, Sordariomycetes), of which most members are also fungicolous. Nematogonum ferrugineum is known as an obligate fungicolous fungus on species of Neonectria, but has also been found on Chaetomella, Cladosporium, Graphium, Melogramma, Tritirachium and Verticillium representatives (Walker & Minter 1981, Gams et al. 2004, Akulov 2011). Based on a megablast search using the ITS sequence, the closest matches in NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database were Melanospora kurssanoviana (GenBank KP981479; Identities 500 / 549 (91 %), 12 gaps (2 %)), Me. singaporensis (GenBank LC146748; Identities 519 / 582 (89 %), 20 gaps (3 %)) and Papulaspora funabasensis (GenBank LC228646; Identities 508 / 569 (89 %), 17 gaps (2 %)). The highest similarities using the tef1 sequence were My. banksiae (GenBank NG_042684; Identities 813 / 842 (97 %), 2 gaps (0 %)), My. schulzeri (GenBank EU041835; Identities 812 / 842 (96 %), 2 gaps (0 %)) and My. spartii (GenBank KR611902; Identities 812 / 843 (96 %), 3 gaps (0 %)). No significant hits were obtained when the tef1 sequence was used in a megablast search. All attempts to generate an LSU sequence for this culture failed, irrespective of using fresh DNA or different primer sets. Neocucurbitaria cava (Schulzer) Valenzuela-Lopez et al., Stud.

Notes: The genus Parathyridaria was recently introduced by Jaklitsch & Voglmayr (2016). Phylogenetically (Fig. 28), Pa. philadelphi is allied to Pa. robiniae, a sexual species recently described from Italy on Robinia pseudoacacia (Tibpromma et al. 2017). Based on a megablast search using the ITS sequence, the closest matches in NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database were Pa. robiniae (GenBank KY511142; Identities 709 / 715 (99 %), no gaps), Roussoella mukdahanensis (GenBank KU940129; Identities 602 / 718 (84 %), 20 gaps (2 %)) and Pa. ramulicola (GenBank NR_147657; Identities 406 / 429 (95 %), 3 gaps (0 %)).

Notes: Phylogenetically the present collection is identical (based on ITS and LSU, and almost identical based on tub2) to Pe. hollandica (Maharachchikumbura et al. 2014). Morphologically, however, they are quite distinct, with Pe. hollandica having conidia that are larger, (25\u2013)25.5\u201333(\u201334) \u00d7 8.5\u201310(\u201310.5) \u03bcm, with 1\u20134 tubular apical appendages, 20\u201340 \u03bcm long. Based on a megablast search using the ITS sequence in NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database, the ITS sequence is identical to Pe. hollandica (CBS 265.33; GenBank NR_147555), Pe. monochaeta (CBS 144.97; GenBank NR_147554) and Pe. funerea (ML4DY; GenBank EF055197).

Notes: Van der Aa & Vanev (2002) placed Phyllosticta hakeae in the genus Microsphaeropsis, and presently no species of Phyllosticta are known from Hakea. Phylogenetically (Fig. 31), Ph. hakeicola is closely related to Ph. telopeae (also Proteaceae; Crous et al. 2000), but can be distinguished by its larger conidia, (12\u2013)13\u201316(\u201318) \u00d7 (7\u2013)8\u20139 \u03bcm (Swart et al. 1998).

Polyscytalum chilense Crous & M.J. Wingf., sp. nov. MycoBank MB824783. Fig. 32. Etymology: Name refers to Chile, the country where this fungus was collected. Mycelium consisting of branched, septate, brown, smooth, 2\u20133 \u03bcm diam hyphae. Conidiophores solitary, erect, 1\u20133-septate, subcylindrical, brown, smooth, straight to geniculous-sinuous, 30\u201360 \u00d7 3\u20134 \u03bcm. Conidiogenous cells terminal and intercalary, subcylindrical to clavate, 7\u201312 \u00d7 3\u20134 \u03bcm; scars arranged in a rachis, prominent, thickened, darkened and refractive, 1\u20131.5 \u03bcm diam. Conidia cylindrical, pale brown, smooth, prominently guttulate, 1-septate, apex obtuse, base truncate, 1\u20131.5 \u03bcm diam, somewhat darkened and refractive, in very long, unbranched chains, (13\u2013)15\u201318(\u201320) \u00d7 (2\u2013)2.5 \u03bcm. Culture characteristics: Colonies erumpent, spreading, with sparse aerial mycelium and feathery, lobate margins, reaching 15 mm diam after 2 wk at 25 \u00b0C. On MEA surface ochreous, reverse chestnut. On PDA surface and reverse amber. On OA surface iron-grey. Specimen examined: Chile, on leaves of Eucalyptus urophylla (Myrtaceae), Jun. 2010, M.J. Wingfield (holotype CBS H-23403, culture ex-type CPC 31946 = CBS 143387). Notes: Sutton (1973) established the genus Anungitea for a genus of hyphomycetes with dark, solitary conidiophores, bearing a head of denticles with flattened conidiogenous scars that are neither thickened nor darkened, and chains of cylindrical, 1-septate subhyaline conidia. Since its introduction, several taxa have been added to the genus, and because the type A. fragilis remains phylogenetically undefined, the generic concept has widened. As seen in the present study, several of these \u201cAnungitea\u201d species cluster with Po. fecundissimum, the type species of Polyscytalum. It has become clear that the generic concepts of these two genera overlap and that several species would be better accommodated in Polyscytalum than in Anungitea. Polyscytalum has cylindrical conidia that vary from being 0\u20131-septate, hyaline to pale brown, smooth, with truncate ends (those in Anungitea have obtuse ends), and the scars can be somewhat darkened and refractive, but unthickened in both genera (see Pseudoanungitea with thickened hila elsewhere in this manuscript). Phylogenetically (Fig. 13), Po. chilense is distinct from all species known from Eucalyptus (Crous et al. 2017a) and is most similar to Po. grevilleae, which has setae, and smaller conidia, (10\u2013)13\u201316(\u201322) \u00d7 (2\u2013)2.5\u20133 \u03bcm (Crous et al. 2016b). Based on a megablast search using the ITS sequence, the closest matches in NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database were Po. grevilleae (GenBank KX228252; Identities 537 / 560 (96 %), no gaps), Po. eucalyptorum (GenBank NR_132904; Identities 534 / 560 (95 %), 1 gap (0 %)) and Po. fecundissimum (GenBank EU035441; Identities 371 / 391 (95 %), 2 gaps (0 %)).

Polyscytalum nullicananum (Crous) Crous, comb. nov. MycoBank MB824788. Basionym: Anungitea nullicana Crous, Persoonia 39: 411. 2017. Description and illustration: Crous et al. (2017b). Specimen examined: Australia, New South Wales, Nullica State Forest, on leaf litter of Eucalyptus sp. (Myrtaceae), 29 Nov. 2016, P.W. Crous (holotype CBS H-23297, culture ex-type CPC 32528 = CBS 143406). Pseudoanungitea Crous, gen. nov. MycoBank MB824789. Etymology: Name refers to its morphological similarity to Anungitea. Mycelium consisting of branched, septate, brown, smooth, 2\u20133 \u03bcm diam hyphae. Conidiophores solitary, erect, septate, subcylindrical, brown, smooth, straight to flexuous. Conidiogenous cells terminal and intercalary, subcylindrical to clavate; scars arranged in a rachis, prominent, thickened, darkened and refractive. Conidia fusoid-ellipsoid, pale brown, smooth, prominently guttulate, 0\u20131-septate, hila somewhat darkened and refractive, in short (1\u20132) unbranched chains. Type species: Pseudoanungitea syzygii (Crous et al.) Crous. Pseudoanungitea syzygii (Crous et al.) Crous, comb. nov. MycoBank MB824790. Basionym: Anungitea syzygii Crous et al., Canad. J. Bot. 73(2): 225. 1995. Description and illustration: Crous et al. (1995). Specimen examined: South Africa, Mpumalanga, Sabie, on leaf litter of Syzygium chordatum (Myrtaceae), Mar. 1993, W.J. Swart (holotype PREM 51687, culture ex-type CPC 578 = CBS 520.93). Notes: Anungitea includes species with dark, solitary conidiophores, bearing a head of denticles with flattened conidiogenous scars that are unthickened and not darkened, and chains of cylindrical, 1-septate subhyaline conidia, with apical and basal scars (Sutton 1973). Anungitopsis is similar but includes taxa with indistinguishable scars arranged in a rachis. Neoanungitea is somewhat intermediate between these two genera, having a rachis, but with flat-tipped loci (Crous et al. 2017b). Because the type species of Anungitea (A. fragilis) is not presently known from culture and needs to be recollected (leaves of Abies balsamea, Manitoba, Canada), the phylogeny of Anungitea remains unresolved, and several unrelated taxa have been described in the genus. The two species treated here cluster apart from the generic clade assumed to be Anungitea s. str. They differ from Anungitea in having terminal and intercalary conidiogenous cells, and refractive, thickened scars that give rise to short conidial chains with somewhat darkened and refractive hila. Pseudoanungitea vaccinii Crous & R.K. Schumach., sp. nov. MycoBank MB824791. Fig. 35. Etymology: Name refers to Vaccinium, the host genus from which this fungus was collected.

On MEA, PDA and OA surface and reverse brown vinaceous. Specimen examined: Germany, near Berlin, on stem of Vaccinium myrtillus (Ericaceae), 16 Jan. 2016, R.K. Schumacher (holotype CBS H-23422, culture ex-type CPC 30522 = CBS 143164). Notes: Based on a megablast search using the ITS sequence, the closest matches in NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database were Anungitea syzygii (GenBank KY853424; Identities 499 / 526 (95 %), 4 gaps (0 %)), Tothia fuscella (GenBank JF927786; Identities 504 / 561 (90 %), 11 gaps (1 %)) and T. spartii (GenBank NR_132917; Identities 430 / 487 (88 %), 15 gaps (3 %)).

Culture characteristics: Colonies after 1 mo at 25 \u00b0C, on OA reaching 6 mm, velvety, brown vinaceous, entire to lobate margin; reverse brown vinaceous. On MEA and PDA reaching 6\u201312 mm, effuse becoming raised, aerial mycelium pale mouse grey, submerged mycelium black, lobate margin; reverse black. Specimen examined: Spain, Castilla la Mancha, Hayedo de la Tejera Negra Natural Park, on dead wood, May 2011, M. Hern\u00e1ndez-Restrepo, J. Mena & J. Guarro (holotype CBS H-23494, culture ex-type CBS 132716). Notes: Pseudoanungitea variabilis is distinct from other species in the genus due to its having two conidial shapes. Some conidia are fusoid-ellipsoid resembling those of Ps. syzygii and Ps. vaccini (Crous et al. 1995, this study). However, Ps. variabilis can be distinguished by the presence of globose conidia. Based on a megablast search using the ITS sequence, the closest matches in NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database were Sympodiella acicola (GenBank KY853468; Identities 370 / 412 (90 %), 17 gaps (4 %)), Tothia fuscella (GenBank JF927786; Identities 469 / 528 (89 %), 13 gaps (2 %)) and T. spartii (GenBank NR_132917; Identities 399 / 448 (89 %), 10 gaps (2 %)).

Notes: The present collection is phylogenetically identical to Pseudocamarosporium africanum. The latter taxon was originally described from branches of Prunus persica in South Africa. Morphologically, the two collections are also similar in that conidia of the ex-type strain of Ps. africana are 1-septate, rarely 3- or 4-celled, brown and thick-walled, verruculose, (4\u2013) 6.5\u20139.5(\u201312) \u00d7 (2.5\u2013)3\u20134(\u20135) \u03bcm (Damm et al. 2008).

Specimens examined: Switzerland, on branch of Platanus sp. (Platanaceae), 24 Jun. 2014, O. Holdenrieder (specimen CBS H-23429, culture CPC 25002 = CBS 144205); ibid. (CPC 25004, 25843, 27400, 30973, 31482). Notes: Pseudocamarosporium and Paracamarosporium were recently introduced to accommodate camarosporium-like taxa that reside in Didymosphaeriaceae (Wijayawardene et al. 2014). Both genera were also shown to include species with a coniothyrium-like morphology (Crous et al. 2015a). Pseudocamarosporium brabeji was treated as Pseudocamarosporium sp. 2. in Crous & Groenewald (2017).

Culture characteristics: Colonies erumpent, spreading, surface folded with moderate aerial mycelium and even, lobate margins, reaching 20 mm diam after 2 wk at 25 \u00b0C. On MEA, PDA and OA surface grey olivaceous, reverse iron-grey. Specimen examined: South Africa, Limpopo Province, Wolkberg, on leaves of Breonadia microcephala (Rubiaceae), Jan. 2010, J. Roux (holotype CBS H-23413, culture ex-type CPC 30153 = CBS 143489). Notes: No species of Pseudocercospora have been described from Breonadia microcephala. The closest allied species to Ps. breonadiae was Ps. planaltinensis, which was described from leaves of a Chamaecrista sp. in Brazil (Fig. 40). However, it is morphologically distinct, having cylindrical to obclavate conidia, 1\u20138-septate, 49\u2013129 \u00d7 3\u20135 \u03bcm (Silva et al. 2016).

Crous (holotype CBS H-23415, culture ex-type CPC 30162 = CBS 143395). Notes: Subplenodomus was established by de Gruyter et al. (2013) for Su. violicola. Phylogenetically Su. iridicola is closely related to Su. galicola, but distinct in that the latter (described from a dead stem of Galium sp. collected in Italy) has larger ascospores [30\u201340 \u00d7 6\u20139 \u03bcm, (3\u2013)4-septate] and asci (66\u2013120 \u00d7 12\u201317 \u03bcm) (Tibpromma et al. 2017).

Teichospora quercus Crous & R.K. Schumach., sp. nov. MycoBank MB824799. Fig. 48. Etymology: Name refers to Quercus, the host genus from which this fungus was collected. Ascomata solitary to gregarious, semi-immersed, becoming erumpent, dark brown, uniloculate, globose with papillate ostiole, 200\u2013350 \u03bcm diam; peridium thick-walled, multi-layered, of textura angularis, brown, becoming hyaline inwards. Asci 8-spored, bitunicate, fissitunicate, cylindrical-clavate, short-stipitate, rounded at apex, with ocular chamber, 60\u2013110 \u00d7 10\u201315 \u03bcm. Ascospores tri- to multiseriate, hyaline, fusiform or ellipsoid-fusoid, straight, widest just above median septum, (1\u2013)3-septate, but becoming golden brown, with mucoid sheath (up to 2.5 \u03bcm diam), (19\u2013)20\u201322(\u201325) \u00d7 (4\u2013)5(\u20136) \u03bcm. Pseudoparaphyses longer than asci, filiform, cells cylindrical, branched, hyaline, thin-walled, smooth, 2\u20132.5 \u03bcm diam.

On OA surface pale olivaceous grey. Specimen examined: France, Cl\u00e9ron, on stroma of pyrenomycete, on branch of Quercus sp. (Fagaceae), 15 Nov. 2015, G. Moyne (holotype CBS H-23404, culture ex-type CPC 30009 = CBS 143396). Notes: The genus Teichospora was treated in detail by Jaklitsch & Voglmayr (2016) and includes several generic synonyms. Although the present collection was initially assumed to represent a new genus, it clusters phylogenetically with other species of Teichospora. It is, however, morphologically distinct, in that the ascospores remain hyaline, and are surrounded by a mucoid sheath, and are only 1(\u20133) transversely septate. The asexual morph, however, is phoma-like, which again resembles those of Teichospora. Nevertheless, if additional gene loci eventually show this clade to represent more than one genus, T. quercus will most likely be placed in a separate genus. Based on a megablast search using the ITS sequence, the closest matches in NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database were T. rubriostiolata (GenBank KU601590; Identities 562 / 589 (95 %), 4 gaps (0 %)), T. melanommoides (GenBank KU601585; Identities 561 / 590 (95 %), 7 gaps (1 %)) and T. acaciae (GenBank NR_138410; Identities 559 / 591 (95 %), 8 gaps (1 %)).

Trochila viburnicola Crous & Denman, sp. nov. MycoBank MB824800. Fig. 49. Etymology: Name refers to the fact that the fungus occurs (icola = dweller) on stems of Viburnum. Conidiomata pale brown, globose, somewhat flattened, 120\u2013250 \u03bcm diam, opening by irregular rupture, becoming acervular; wall of 3\u20136 layers of pale brown textura angularis. Macroconidiophores lining inner cavity, hyaline, smooth, subcylindrical, branched, 1\u20137-septate, 10\u201340 \u00d7 4\u20136 \u03bcm. Macroconidiogenous cells integrated, terminal and intercalary, hyaline, smooth, subcylindrical to doliiform, 5\u201313 \u00d7 4\u20135 \u03bcm, with semi-flared collarette, 1\u20133 \u03bcm tall, proliferating percurrently. Macroconidia solitary, hyaline, smooth, guttulate, aseptate, subcylindrical, straight, apex obtuse, base truncate, 3\u20134 \u03bcm diam with prominent marginal frill, (5\u2013)6\u20137 \u00d7 (3\u2013)4 \u03bcm. Microconidiophores similar in morphology to macroconidiophores, 8\u201320 \u00d7 3\u20134 \u03bcm. Microconidiogenous cells terminal and intercalary, subcylindrical to ampulliform, 4\u20137 \u00d7 2.5\u20133 \u03bcm, proliferating percurrently.

Culture characteristics: Colonies flat, spreading, surface folded, with sparse aerial mycelium and smooth, lobate margins, reaching 50 mm diam after 2 wk at 25 \u00b0C. On MEA, PDA and OA surface pale luteous to ochreous, reverse ochreous. Specimen examined: UK, England, Upton Grey, on twig cankers of Viburnum sp. (Adoxaceae), 28 Mar. 2016, P.W. Crous (holotype CBS H-23416, culture ex-type CPC 30254 = CBS 144206). Notes: The genus Sirophoma is known from Viburnum, but is distinct from the present collection in that it has pycnidial conidiomata with central ostioles, long flexuous conidiophores, and globose to pyriform conidia. Based on DNA sequence similarity, the present asexual collection is similar to sequences of the sexual morph Trochila (Dermateaceae). Trochila has been linked to cryptocline-like asexual morphs, and hence it is tentatively placed in this genus. A species of Trochila known from Viburnum is T. tini, but as this species is not known from culture and only the sexual morph is known, a comparison is impossible. Based on a megablast search using the ITS sequence, the closest matches in NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database were Crumenulopsis sororia (GenBank KY941133; Identities 437 / 487 (90 %), 7 gaps (1 %)), Cenangiopsis quercicola (GenBank LT158425; Identities 506 / 552 (92 %), 4 gaps (0 %)) and Vestigium trifidum (GenBank NR_121556; Identities 502 / 551 (91 %), 3 gaps (0 %)).

Only distant hits to Cucurbitaria and Trichoderma were obtained when the tef1 sequence was used in a megablast search. Varicosporellopsis aquatilis Lechat & J. Fourn., Ascomycete.org 8(3): 87. 2016. Fig. 50. On SNA: Mycelium consisting of hyaline, branched, septate, smooth, 3\u20135 \u03bcm diam hyphae, lacking chlamydospores, and frequently forming hyphal coils. Conidiophores solitary, erect, branched at base, 0\u20132-septate, or reduced to conidiogenous cells; branched conidiophores consist of a basal stipe, 15\u201330 \u00d7 3\u20135 \u03bcm, giving rise to 1\u20133 lateral branches, 0\u20131-septate, or conidiogenous cells, 40\u2013100 \u00d7 3\u20135 \u03bcm.

Specimen examined: The Netherlands, Culemborg, from garden soil, Feb. 2017, H. van Warenburg, culture JW75003 = CBS 143509. Notes: Morphologically Varicosporellopsis aquatilis resembles Acremonium curvulum in having curved, fusoid-ellipsoid conidia with truncate hila. However, it can be distinguished in that it lacks chlamydospores, and has much larger conidia than A. curvulum (4\u20136.7 \u00d7 1.4\u20132.1 \u03bcm; Gams 1971), from which it is also phylogenetically distinct. Based on a megablast search using the ITS sequence, the closest matches in NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database were V. aquatilis (GenBank KU233187; Identities 524 / 530 (99 %), 2 gaps (0 %)), Fusarium merismoides var. violaceum (GenBank EU860060; Identities 842 / 906 (93 %), 27 gaps (2 %)) and Thyronectria asturiensis (GenBank KJ570690; Identities 854 / 919 (93 %), 25 gaps (2 %)). The highest similarities using the LSU sequence were V. aquatilis (GenBank KU233189; Identities 835 / 836 (99 %), no gaps), Paracremonium variiforme (GenBank KU746739; Identities 823 / 836 (98 %), no gaps) and Pa. contagium (GenBank KP012631; Identities 790 / 804 (98 %), no gaps). Only distant hits were obtained using the actA sequence; some of these were Verticillium dahliae (GenBank CP010981; Identities 874 / 973 (90 %), 15 gaps (1 %)), Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. dianthi (GenBank LT841228; Identities 870 / 977 (89 %), 17 gaps (1 %)) and Fusarium graminearum (GenBank HG970335; Identities 872 / 979 (89 %), 21 gaps (2 %)).

Crous (CBS H-23312, culture CPC 32544 = CBS 143440). Notes: Vermiculariopsiella dichapetali was described from leaves of Dichapetalum rhodesicum collected in Botswana (Crous et al. 2014), and these are the first records from Australia. Based on a megablast search using the ITS sequence, the closest matches in NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database were Ve. dichapetali (GenBank KX306771; Identities 532 / 534 (99 %), no gaps), Ve.immersa (GenBank KY853476; Identities 532 / 534 (99 %), 2 gaps (0 %)) and Ve. acaciae (GenBank NR_145253; Identities 520 / 536 (97 %), 7 gaps (1 %)).

Notes: The present camarosporium-like collection is described in the genus Wettsteinina, although this genus is primarily known from its sexual morphs (Zhang et al. 2012), with one reference to a possible stagonospora-like asexual morph (Farr & Rossman 2018). Based on a megablast search using the ITS sequence, the closest matches in NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database were Alpinaria rhododendri (GenBank NR_147686; Identities 505 / 534 (95 %), 10 gaps (1 %)), Herpotrichia juniperi (GenBank JX981496; Identities 443 / 472 (94 %), 7 gaps (1 %)) and He. pinetorum (GenBank KP966102; Identities 442 / 471 (94 %), 8 gaps (1 %)).

On MEA and PDA surface and reverse amber. On OA surface olivaceous grey. Specimens examined: Australia, New South Wales, Nullica State Forest, on Eucalyptus sp. (Myrtaceae) leaf litter, 29 Nov. 2016, P.W. Crous, (CBS H-23291, culture CPC 32324 = CBS 143502); ibid. (CPC 32526). Notes: The genus Xyladictyochaeta, based on Xy. lusitanica, was recently described from Eucalyptus leaves collected in Portugal (Hern\u00e1ndez-Restrepo et al. 2017), and this is the first record of this fungus from Australia. Xyladictyochaeta represents an undescribed family in Xylariales, and Xyladictyochaetaceae is introduced to accommodate it. Based on a megablast search using the ITS sequence, the closest matches in NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database were Xy. lusitanica (GenBank KY853479; Identities 571 / 573 (99 %), no gaps), Anungitea eucalyptigena (GenBank KY173383; Identities 517 / 578 (89 %), 16 gaps (2 %)) and Beltraniopsis neolitseae (GenBank NR_148072; Identities 521 / 583 (89 %), 19 gaps (3 %)). The ITS sequences of CPC 32324 and 32526 differs with three nucleotides (morphologically they are similar, except for prominent differences in conidiophore length). The highest similarities using the LSU sequence were Xy. lusitanica (GenBank KY853543; Identities 801 / 801 (100 %), no gaps), Phlogicylindrium eucalypti (GenBank DQ923534; Identities 822 / 844 (97 %), no gaps) and Phl. mokarei (GenBank KY173521; Identities 796 / 818 (97 %), no gaps). The LSU sequences of CPC 32324 and CPC 32526 are identical. No significant matches were obtained using the tef1 sequences and the tef1 sequences of CPC 32324 and CPC 32526 differ with one nucleotide and a single CA-repeat. No significant matches were obtained using the tub2 sequence and the tub2 sequences of CPC 32324 and CPC 32526 are 99 % identical (806 / 813, 1 gap). Zygosporium pseudogibbum Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB824803. Fig. 54. Etymology: Name refers to its morphological similarity to Zygosporium gibbum. Conidiophores solitary, erect, consisting of 1\u20132 pale brown basal cells forming a stipe, 7\u201315 \u00d7 3\u20134 \u03bcm, giving rise to a curved, dark brown terminal vesicle, 11\u201312 \u00d7 6\u20138 \u03bcm. Conidiogenous cells arranged in a whorl of 3\u20134 on a terminal vesicle, hyaline, smooth, reniform, 4\u20136 \u00d7 3\u20134 \u03bcm. Vesicle with single apical cell, 4\u20135 \u00d7 3\u20134 \u03bcm, pale brown, cylindrical, with obtuse apex and prominent collarette. Conidia solitary, globose, verruculose, faintly olivaceous, 6(\u20137) \u03bcm diam. Culture characteristics: Colonies flat, spreading, surface folded, with sparse to moderate aerial mycelium and smooth, lobate margins, reaching 50 mm diam after 2 wk at 25 \u00b0C. On MEA surface buff to dirty white, reverse luteous. On PDA surface buff to dirty white, reverse saffron. On OA surface buff to dirty white. Specimen examined: Malaysia, Sabah, on leaves of Eucalyptus pellita (Myrtaceae), Mar. 2016, M.J. Wingfield (holotype CBS H-23411, culture ex-type CPC 30421 = CBS 143503). Notes: Morphologically, the present collection matches the description of Z. gibbum, a European taxon (reference isolate, FMR 13130 = CBS 137306; leaf litter Canary Islands; Hernandez-Restrepo et al. 2017), which has a wide host range and wide geographical distribution (Ellis 1971). Phylogenetically, however, it clusters sister to this species, and thus a new taxon is introduced to accommodate it. The vesicle gives rise to a single apical cell that appears to be a conidiogenous cell, but could play a different role entirely (moisture droplet, insect dispersal). Active spore dispersal was observed on host tissue, and it could be that conidia on this cell can actively discharge. Based on a megablast search using the ITS sequence, the closest matches in NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database were Z. gibbum (GenBank KY853482; Identities 481 / 504 (95 %), 1 gap (0 %)), Podosordaria muli (GenBank JX156377; Identities 462 / 499 (93 %), 14 gaps (2 %)) and Poronia australiensis (GenBank KP012826; Identities 384 / 434 (88 %), 21 gaps (4 %)). The highest similarities using the LSU sequence were Z. gibbum (GenBank KY853546; Identities 739 / 757 (98 %), 6 gaps (0 %)), Atrotorquata spartii (GenBank KP325443; Identities 818 / 846 (97 %), 2 gaps (0 %)) and Circinotrichum cycadis (GenBank KJ869178; Identities 804 / 849 (95 %), 6 gaps (0 %)). Only distant hits were obtained using the actA sequence; some of these were Penicillifer pulcher (GenBank KM231107; Identities 390 / 418 (93 %), no gaps), Neonectria neomacrospora (GenBank KM231143; Identities 389 / 418 (93 %), no gaps) and Cylindrodendrum album (GenBank KM231152; Identities 387 / 418 (93 %), no gaps). No significant hits were obtained when the tub2 sequence was used."
