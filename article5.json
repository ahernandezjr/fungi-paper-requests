   "text": "INTRODUCTION This paper represents the second contribution to the New and Interesting Fungi (NIF) series, aimed at expanding the body of knowledge of fungal biodiversity and fungal conservation. The series focuses on new records, new sexual-asexual connections, consolidation of sexual and asexual genera following the abandonment of dual nomenclature for fungi (Hawksworth et al. 2011, Wingfield et al. 2012), and the description of fungal taxa, or notes relating to interesting observations (Crous et al. 2018c). The series represents a regular feature of the journal Fungal Systematics and Evolution (www.FUSE-journal.org). It is hoped that it will provide an attractive resource for mycologists to publish single new species or to highlight the relevance of important fungi. Mycologists and other researchers wishing to contribute to future issues of NIF are encouraged to contact the Editor-in-Chief (p.crous@westerdijkinstitute.nl). MATERIALS AND METHODS Isolates Samples were placed in damp chambers and incubated at room temperature for 1\u20133 d. Single conidial colonies were grown from sporulating conidiomata in Petri dishes containing 2 % malt extract agar (MEA) as described by Crous et al. (1991). Leaf and stem tissues bearing ascomata were soaked in water for approximately 2 h, after which they were attached to the undersides of the lids of Petri dishes containing MEA. After ascospores had been ejected onto the MEA surface, germination patterns were determined after 24 h, and single ascospore or conidial cultures were established following the method described by (Crous 1998). Colonies were sub-cultured on 2 % potato-dextrose agar (PDA), oatmeal agar (OA), MEA (Crous et al. 2009c), autoclaved pine needles on 2 % tap water agar (PNA) (Smith et al. 1996), or autoclaved banana leaves (BLA), and incubated at 25 \u00b0C under continuous near-ultraviolet light to promote sporulation. Reference strains and specimens of the studied fungi are maintained in the CBS culture collection (CBS) of the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute (WI), Utrecht, the Netherlands. DNA extraction, amplification (PCR) and phylogeny Fungal mycelium (Table 1) was scraped from the agar surface of cultures with a sterile scalpel and the genomic DNA was isolated using the Wizard\u00ae Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega Corporation, WI, USA) following the manufacturers' protocols. Nine loci were amplified following previously published protocols. First, the 28S nrRNA gene (LSU) and internal transcribed spacer regions with intervening 5.8S nrRNA gene (ITS) of the nrDNA operon were sequenced for all the isolates included in this study (for amplification conditions, see Fan et al. 2018). Other loci were sequenced for various species or genera using primers and conditions specific for those groups of fungi (Table 1). Amplification of the partial DNA-directed RNA polymerase II second largest subunit gene (rpb2), the partial translation elongation factor 1-alpha gene (tef1) and the partial beta-tubulin gene (tub2) followed Braun et al. (2018), while the amplification of the partial actin gene (act), the partial calmodulin gene (cmdA), the partial glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (gapdh) and the partial histone H3 gene (his3) followed Videira et al. (2016). The resulting fragments were sequenced in both directions using the respective PCR primers and the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit v. 3.1 (Applied Biosystems Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA); DNA sequencing amplicons were purified through Sephadex G-50 Superfine columns (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in MultiScreen HV plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Purified sequence reactions were analysed on an Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The DNA sequences were analysed and consensus sequences were computed using SeqMan Pro v. 13 (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA). The sequences for each gene region were subjected to megablast searches (Zhang et al. 2000) to identify closely related sequences in the NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database. The results are provided as part of the species notes or as selected phylogenetic trees. Phylogenetic trees were generated using Bayesian analyses performed with MrBayes v. 3.2.6 (Ronquist et al. 2012) for the overview trees and Maximum Parsimony analyses performed with PAUP v. 4.0b10 (Swofford 2003) as explained in Braun et al. (2018) for the genus and species trees. All resulting trees were printed with Geneious v. 11.0.3 (http://www.geneious.com, Kearse et al. 2012) and the layout of the trees was done in Adobe Illustrator v. CC 2017. Statistical measures calculated included tree length (TL), consistency index (CI), retention index (RI) and rescaled consistency index (RC). Morphology Slide preparations were mounted in lactic acid, Shear\u2019s mounting fluid or water, from colonies sporulating on MEA, PDA, PNA, BLA or OA. Sections through conidiomata were made by hand. Observations were made with a Nikon SMZ25 dissection-microscope, and with a Zeiss Axio Imager 2 light microscope using differential interference contrast (DIC) illumination and images recorded on a Nikon DS-Ri2 camera with associated software. Colony characters and pigment production were noted after 2\u20134 wk of growth on MEA, PDA and OA (Crous et al. 2009c) incubated at 25 \u00b0C. Colony colours (surface and reverse) were scored using the colour charts of Rayner (1970). Sequences derived in this study were deposited in GenBank (Table 1), the alignment in TreeBASE (www.treebase.org; study number S23853), and taxonomic novelties in MycoBank (www.MycoBank.org; Crous et al. 2004).

Asci aparaphysate, fasciculate, bitunicate, narrowly ellipsoid to subcylindrical, straight to incurved, 8-spored, 28\u201337 \u00d7 6\u20137 \u00b5m. Ascospores multiseriate, overlapping, hyaline, guttulate, thin-walled, straight to slightly curved, fusoid-ellipsoid with obtuse ends, widest in middle of the apical cell, medianly 1-septate, not to slightly constricted at septum, tapering toward both ends, 10\u201312 \u00d7 (2\u2013)2.5 \u00b5m. Culture characteristics: Colonies erumpent, spreading, with moderate aerial mycelium, and smooth, lobate margins, covering dish in 2 wk. On MEA surface pale olivaceous grey to olivaceous grey, reverse iron-grey; on PDA surface olivaceous grey with patches of pale olivaceous grey, reverse iron-grey; on OA surface olivaceous grey with patches of dirty white. Material examined: New Zealand, Auckland, Bucklands Beach, 22 Wells Road, on leaves of Metrosideros excelsa ( Myrtaceae), 2015, R. Thangavel, T16_03926C = CBS H-23809, culture CBS 144635 = CPC 32782. Notes: Amycosphaerella africana, which is the oldest name for this taxon, is known from Australia (Buckinghamia sp., Eucalyptus grandis, E. globulus), Colombia (E. grandis), New Zealand (Dracaena draco), Portugal (E. globulus), South Africa (E. cladocalyx, E. deanei, E. grandis, E. radiata, E. smithii, E. viminalis), and Zambia (E. globulus) (Videira et al. 2017). Based on a megablast search of NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database, the ITS sequence was identical to Mycosphaerella buckinghamiae (GenBank EU707856.2; Identities = 523/523 (100 %)), Amycosphaerella africana (as Mycosphaerella africana, GenBank AY626981.1; Identities = 523/523 (100 %)), and related to Pantospora guazumae (GenBank NR_119971.1; Identities = 521/523 (99 %), no gaps). Closest hits using the LSU sequence are Amycosphaerella africana (GenBank MH874180.1; Identities = 785/785 (100 %)), Mycosphaerella buckinghamiae (GenBank EU707856.2; Identities = 785/785 (100 %)), and Distomycovellosiella brachycarpa (as Passalora brachycarpa, GenBank GU214664.1; Identities = 782/785 (99 %), 2 gaps (0 %)). The tef1 sequence was identical to numerous sequences of Amycosphaerella africana (e.g. as Mycosphaerella ellipsoidea, GenBank JX901653.1; Identities = 394/394 (100 %)). Closest hits using the tub2 sequence had highest similarity to Amycosphaerella africana (GenBank LC121222.1; Identities = 571/572 (99 %), no gaps), Pseudocercospora fijiensis (GenBank XM_007921924.1; Identities = 566/616 (92 %), no gaps), and Zymoseptoria tritici (GenBank XM_003856727.1; Identities = 552/616 (90 %), no gaps). Bacillicladium clematidis Crous & R.K. Schumach., sp. nov. MycoBank MB829299. Fig. 6. Etymology: Name reflects the host genus Clematis from which it was isolated. Mycelium consisting of pale brown, smooth, branched, 1.5\u20132 \u00b5m diam hyphae that become swollen and constricted at septa in the conidiogenous region, where individual cells become more ellipsoid and clavate to globose, up to 5 \u00b5m diam. Conidiophores reduced to conidiogenous cells on hyphae, pale brown, smooth, phialidic, 0.5\u20131 \u00d7 1 \u00b5m, with inconspicuous collarette, not flared. Conidia solitary, ellipsoid, pale brown, smooth, guttulate, aseptate, apex obtuse, basal locus truncate, 0.5 \u00b5m diam; older conidia undergoing microcyclic conidiation, (3\u2013)4\u20134.5(\u20135) \u00d7 (1.5\u2013)2.5\u20133(\u20135) \u00b5m. Culture characteristics: Colonies flat, spreading, lacking aerial mycelium and even, lobate margin, reaching 6 mm diam after 2 wk at 25 \u00b0C. On MEA, PDA and OA surface and reverse umber. Typus: Austria, Gaaden, branch of Clematis vitalbae (Ranunculaceae), 21 Apr. 2017, M. Mann & R.K. Schumacher, HPC 2101, RKS 102 (holotype CBS H-23828, culture ex-type CPC 33882 = CBS 145035). Notes: Bacillicladium clematidis is phylogenetically allied to the genus Bacillicladium, based on B. lobatum. Bacillicladium lobatum, which grows on bare granite walls, has three different growth habits in vitro, dependent on cultivation medium, temperature and colony age. But morphologically, B. clematidis provides an appropriate fit for the genus, sharing the black yeast-like growth in culture (R\u00e9blov\u00e1 et al. 2016). Based on a megablast search of NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database, the closest hits using the ITS sequence had highest similarity to Camptophora hylomeconis (GenBank NR_132881.1; Identities = 352/402 (88 %), 20 gaps (5 %)), Aphanophora eugeniae (GenBank NR_132829.1; Identities = 394/466 (85 %), 24 gaps (5 %)), and Ceramothyrium thailandicum (GenBank NR_137768.1; Identities = 346/415 (83 %), 36 gaps (8 %)). Closest hits using the LSU sequence are Bacillicladium lobatum (GenBank LT558703.1; Identities = 822/863 (95 %), 2 gaps (0 %)), Veronaea botryosa (GenBank MH875937.1; Identities = 818/869 (94 %), 5 gaps (0 %)), and Veronaea constricta (GenBank MH873920.1; Identities = 811/862 (94 %), 5 gaps (0 %)). No significant hits were obtained when the tub2 sequence was used in blastn and megablast searches. Beltrania rhombica Penz., Michelia 2(8): 474. 1882. Fig. 7. Setae rarely observed, erect, dark brown, thick-walled, 7\u201310-septate, straight to flexuous, tapering to an acute apex, 200\u2013300 \u00d7 4\u20135 \u00b5m, with lobed basal cell, 6\u20138 \u00b5m diam. Conidiophores erect, unbranched, medium brown, smooth, multi-septate, 50\u2013300 \u00d7 4\u20137 \u00b5m.

Culture characteristics: Colonies spreading, with moderate aerial mycelium, covering dish after 2 wk at 25 \u00b0C. On MEA surface dark brick, reverse fawn; on PDA surface and reverse umber; on OA surface umber. Material examined: Chile, Llanos, on leaves of Eucalyptus urophylla (Myrtaceae), Jul. 2010, M.J. Wingfield, HPC 1412, CBS H-23264, culture CPC 31775 = CBS 144521. Notes: Beltrania pseudorhombica was described from needles of Pinus tabulaeformis collected in Beijing, China (Crous et al. 2014), and distinguished from B. rhombica, which has longer setae (can be up to 330 \u00b5m long, and wider conidia 15\u201330 \u00d7 7\u201314 \u00b5m; Ellis 1971). There is no ex-type strain for B. rhombica, and it needs to be recollected on Citrus limon in Italy to clarify its taxonomy. Based on a megablast search of NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database, the closest hits using the ITS sequence had highest similarity to Beltrania rhombica (GenBank MH857718.1; Identities = 574/577 (99 %), no gaps), Beltrania pseudorhombica (GenBank NR_148074.1; Identities = 574/577 (99 %), no gaps), and Beltrania querna (GenBank MH856775.1; Identities = 530/538 (99 %), no gaps). Closest hits using the LSU sequence are Beltrania rhombica (GenBank MF580252.1; Identities = 823/823 (100 %), no gaps), Beltrania pseudorhombica (GenBank NG_058667.1; Identities = 810/812 (99 %), no gaps), and Beltrania querna (GenBank MH875474.1; Identities = 859/866 (99 %), 2 gaps (0 %)).

Conidiophores erect, simple, single, rarely in groups, mostly unbranched, straight to slightly flexuous, 2\u20133-septate, thick-walled on PDA, thin-walled on OA, olivaceous brown, verruculose, 80\u2013100 \u00d7 2.5\u20133.5 \u00b5m, with bulbous apex, 6\u20137 \u00b5m diam, bearing a whorl of 10\u201312 conidiogenous cells. Conidiogenous cells terminal, elongate, doliiform to subcylindrical, pale brown, smooth, 9\u201312 \u00d7 4\u20134.5 \u00b5m, with conspicuous collarettes. Conidia aggregating in slimy mass with brown exudate on PDA, but in long unbranched dry chains on OA (without exudate), dimorphic, conidia globose, becoming dark brown and verruculose, (4\u2013)5(\u20136) \u00b5m diam, or ellipsoid, pale brown, verruculose, 9\u201310 \u00d74\u20135 \u00b5m. Culture characteristics: Colonies flat, spreading, with sparse to moderate aerial mycelium and smooth, lobate margin, reaching 30 mm diam after 2 wk at 25 \u00b0C. On MEA surface olivaceous grey, reverse umber in middle, sienna in outer region; on PDA surface ochreous with diffuse saffron pigment, reverse vinaceous; on OA surface saffron. Material examined: Thailand, Rachaburi Province, Bangkok, on leaves of Musa sp. (Musaceae), 2008, P.W. Crous, HPC 2156, CBS H-23831, culture CPC 33958 = CBS 145062. Notes: Brevistachys lateralis was described from leaves of Musa sp. collected in Queensland, Australia (Lombard et al. 2016). This is the first record of the fungus from Thailand where it also occurs on Musa leaves.

Typus: South Africa, Gauteng Province, Gauteng, on leaves of Gomphrena globosa (Amaranthaceae), 2010, P.W. Crous, HPC 1516 (holotype CBS H-23803, culture ex-type CPC 32470 = CBS 144613). Notes: A DNA phylogeny for most common species of Cercospora known from culture was presented by Groenewald et al. (2013), with secondary barcode genes treated by Bakhshi et al. (2018). Cercospora gomphrenigena was collected from leaves of Gomphrena globosa in South Africa in an attempt to resolve the identity of Cercospora pretoriensis that occurs on this host (conidia narrowly cylindrical to subacicular, 15\u201390 \u00d7 2\u20134.5 \u03bcm; Braun et al. 2015), from which C. gomphrenigena is morphologically distinct, having much longer and wider conidia. It is morphologically closer to C. gomphrenae [conidiophores in small, divergent fascicles, 30\u2013300 \u00d7 3\u20137 \u03bcm, conidiogenous cells 10\u201330 \u03bcm long, conidia 30\u2013300(\u2013450) \u00d7 2\u20135 \u03bcm, 3\u201320-septate; Braun et al. 2015], but is distinct in having longer conidiophores and conidiogenous cells, wider scars, and wider conidia. Based on a megablast search of NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database, the ITS sequence was identical to Cercospora dichondrae (GenBank MK039698.1; Identities = 525/525 (100 %)), Cercospora beticola (GenBank MH424448.1; Identities = 525/525 (100 %)), and Cercospora malayensis (GenBank MH129519.1; Identities = 525/525 (100 %)). The LSU sequence is identical to those of numerous Cercospora species, e.g. Cercospora sesami (GenBank MK029365.1; Identities = 783/783 (100 %)). Closest hits using the cmdA sequence had highest similarity to Cercospora samambaiae (GenBank KT037463.1; Identities = 448/448 (100 %)), Cercospora sp.

Typus: Austria, lower Austria, Gaaden, on Clematis vitalba (Ranunculaceae), 21 Apr. 2017, M. Mann & R.K. Schumacher, HPC 2101 = RKS 102 (holotype CBS H-23827, culture ex-type CPC 33880 = CBS 144983). Notes: Although Cyphellophora clematidis was isolated from Clematis vitalba, Cyphellophora also contains species that are associated with human and animal skin and nails (Gao et al. 2015). Cyphellophora clematidis is phylogenetically distinct from other species presently known based on their DNA sequences, and is introduced here as new, being morphologically distinct in that it has predominantly aseptate conidia.

Material examined: Thailand, Chiang Mai Province, Chiang Mai, on unidentified host plant, 2008, R. Cheewangkoon, CBS H-23813, culture CPC 33044 = CBS 145050. Notes: The genus Dichotomophthora was recently revised by Marin-Felix et al. (2019), who accepted four species associated with leaf spots on various host plants. Dichotomophthora basellae was described as having conidia that are 32\u201386 \u00d7 10\u201318 \u03bcm, ellipsoid to cylindrical rounded at ends, and 2\u20135-distoseptate. The present isolate is morphologically atypical, as its conidia are frequently forking at the apex. Phylogenetically however, it is identical to D. basellae, and was collected at the same locality. Based on a megablast search of NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database, the closest hits using the ITS sequence had highest similarity to Dichotomophthora basellae (GenBank NR_158422.1; Identities = 595/595 (100 %), no gaps) and Dichotomophthora lutea (GenBank NR_158420.1; Identities = 590/596 (99 %), 1 gap (0 %)).

Sanchez et al., HPC 2230 (holotype CBS H-23836, culture ex-type CPC 34580 = CBS 145038). Notes: Exophiala includes several species of dematiaceous hyphomycetes that are clinically relevant (de Hoog 1977). Species of Exophiala are however commonly isolated from plant litter and soil. Phylogenetically E. abietophila is distinct from all species presently known from their DNA sequence data. Based on a megablast search of NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database, the closest hits using the ITS sequence had highest similarity to Exophiala moniliae (GenBank HE605213.1; Identities = 567/643 (88 %), 34 gaps (5 %)), Exophiala bergeri (GenBank MH857080.1; Identities = 484/544 (89 %), 25 gaps (4 %)), and Atrokylindriopsis setulosa (GenBank KP337330.1; Identities = 516/576 (90 %), 19 gaps (3 %)).

On MEA, PDA and OA surface and reverse olivaceous grey. Typus: Ukraine, Kharkiv, Forest park, on fallen decorticated trunk of cf. Quercus sp. (Fagaceae) in a native oak-maple-ash forest, 28 Oct. 2016, A. Akulov, CWU (MYC) AS 6112 = HPC 1509 (holotype CBS H-23802, culture ex-type CPC 32464 = CBS 144622). Notes: Exophiala (Herpotrichiellaceae) is commonly isolated from decaying wood, soil, and plant litter. This genus of dematiaceous hyphomycetes, commonly referred to as black yeasts, is morphologically variable, with conidiophores ranging from well-defined penicillate structures as in E. lignicola, or solitary loci on hyphae. The genus presently contains approximately 60 epithets, several of which have Capronia sexual morphs (Untereiner 1997). Numerous species of Exophiala / Capronia are known as host-specific fungicolous or lichenicolous fungi (Halici et al., 2010; Friebes, 2012). Phylogenetically, E. lignicola is distinct from those species known from their DNA sequences, and based on its unique conidiophores, it is treated as a unique taxon. Based on a megablast search of NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database, the closest hits using the ITS sequence had highest similarity to Rhinocladiella coryli (GenBank NR_155727.1; Identities = 542/612 (89 %), 18 gaps (2 %)), Exophiala eucalypticola (GenBank NR_158438.1; Identities = 518/589 (88 %), 21 gaps (3 %)), and Rhinocladiella aquaspersa (GenBank MH374866.1; Identities = 539/619 (87 %), 32 gaps (5 %)).

Carnegie, HPC 1445 (holotype CBS H-23796, culture ex-type CPC 31724 = CBS 144621). Notes: Fuscostagonospora was introduced for a sexual species occurring on bamboo (Tanaka et al. 2015). The present collection represents an asexual morph, and is thus difficult to compare with the known sexual species in the genus, but it is placed in Fuscostagonospora based on its phylogeny. Based on a megablast search of NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database, the closest hits using the ITS sequence had highest similarity to Periconia pseudobyssoides (GenBank KY364628.1; Identities = 426/464 (92 %), 10 gaps (2 %)), Periconia byssoides (GenBank KY364620.1; Identities = 426/464 (92 %), 10 gaps (2 %)), and Fuscostagonospora sasae (GenBank NR_153964.1; Identities = 425/468 (91 %), 16 gaps (3 %)).

Culture characteristics: Colonies flat, spreading, with folded surface, sparse to moderate aerial mycelium and smooth, lobate margin, covering dish after 2 wk at 25 \u00b0C. On MEA surface pale olivaceous, reverse luteous; on PDA surface and reverse olivaceous grey; on OA surface olivaceous grey. Typus: Germany, near Berlin, on dead leaf of Carex remota (Cyperaceae), 2 Jun. 2017, R.K. Schumacher, HPC 2136 = RKS 122 (holotype CBS H-23793, culture ex-type CPC 33925 = CBS 145041). Notes: Gaeumannomycella was introduced by Hern\u00e1ndez-Restrepo et al. (2016) for a genus of fungi morphologically similar to Gaeumannomyces, and associated with a disease on Cyperaceae. Gaeumannomycella caricicola is phylogenetically distinct from Gaeumannomycella caricis, the only other species presently known in the genus. Of interest is the fact that both species occur on Carex. Based on a megablast search of NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database, the closest hits using the ITS sequence had highest similarity to Slopeiomyces cylindrosporus (as Gaeumannomyces cylindrosporus, GenBank JF508361.1; Identities = 506/519 (97 %), 3 gaps (0 %)), Gaeumannomycella caricis (GenBank KX306478.1; Identities = 523/553 (95 %), 10 gaps (1 %)), and Nakataea oryzae (GenBank FJ746639.1; Identities = 511/550 (93 %), 9 gaps (1 %)).

Culture characteristics: Colonies erumpent, spreading, with moderate aerial mycelium and feathery, lobate margins, reaching 35 mm diam after 2 wk. On MEA fawn, reverse cinnamon; on PDA isabelline, reverse brown vinaceous; on OA vinaceous buff. Typus: Italy, on twig of Prunus persica (Rosaceae), deposited in 1956, M. Ribaldi (holotype CBS H-23837, culture ex-type IMI 146912 = CBS 194.56). Notes: Hansfordia pulvinata has many proposed synonyms (Deighton 1972), which based on morphology, appear similar to the type. However, H. pruni differs in that it has longer conidiophores, more aggregated sub-denticulate loci on its conidiogenous cells, and smaller conidia. Based on a megablast search of NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database, the ITS sequence was identical to Hansfordia pulvinata (GenBank KU683763.1; Identities = 1040/1040 (100 %)); other closest hits included Entosordaria quercina (GenBank MF488994.1; Identities = 842/915 (92 %), 20 gaps (2 %)), and Entosordaria perfidiosa (GenBank MF488993.1; Identities = 840/914 (92 %), 18 gaps (1 %)).

Crous, HPC 1734, CBS H-23581, culture CPC 32119 = CBS 144422. Notes: Hansfordia pulvinata (a mycoparasite on other fungi, including Fulvia fulva on tomatoes; Peresse & le Picard 1980) was originally described from branches of Alnus sp. collected in North America. It needs to be recollected in the USA to fix the application of the name. Morphologically however, the culture considered in this study applies best to the current concept for this taxon (Ellis 1971, 1976, Deighton 1972). Hansfordia pulvinata has been suggested as possible biological control agent for plant pathogenic fungi (Mitchell & Taber 1986, Alderman et al. 2010). Based on a megablast search of NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database, the closest hits using the ITS sequence had highest similarity to Hansfordia pulvinata (GenBank LC177970.1; Identities = 468/471 (99 %), no gaps), Hansfordia pulvinata (GenBank MH863749.1; Identities = 510/546 (93 %), 11 gaps (2 %)), Gyrothrix verticiclada (GenBank KC775750.1; Identities = 407/463 (88 %), 17 gaps (3 %)), Selenodriella fertilis (GenBank KP859055.1; Identities = 473/544 (87 %), 24 gaps (4 %)), and Daldinia bambusicola (GenBank KY610385.1; Identities =474/553 (86 %), 22 gaps (3 %)).

Notes: The genus Caliciopsis (based on C. pinea) represents two phylogenetically distinct, well-supported clades, one of which is ascribed here to the former generic synonym, Hypsotheca, which appears to be the oldest name available for this clade. Hypsotheca (based on Hypsotheca subcorticalis; globose ascospores) was formerly distinguished from Caliciopsis (Caliciopsis pinea; ellipsoid ascospores) based on ascospore shape, although Fitzpatrick (1942) did not consider this character to be significant at generic level. Morphologically there are few differences between these genera, except that species of Hypsotheca known from culture also form a phaeoacremoniumlike synasexual morph in culture, which has not yet been observed for species of Caliciopsis s.str. Hypsotheca pleomorpha was recently described as the causal agent of a canker disease of Eucalyptus spp. in Australia (Pascoe et al. 2018), and is reported here from leaves of Eucalyptus piperita, although its possible role as foliar pathogen remains unknown. Based on a megablast search of NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database, the ITS sequence was identical to Caliciopsis pleomorpha (GenBank MG641785.1; Identities = 523/523 (100 %)), and related to Corynelia uberata (GenBank KU204606.1; Identities = 511/526 (97 %), 5 gaps (0 %)) and Caliciopsis maxima (GenBank KX891229.1; Identities = 467/533 (88 %), 20 gaps (3 %)). Closest hits using the LSU sequence are Caliciopsis nigra (GenBank KP144011.1; Identities = 769/826 (93 %), 9 gaps (1 %)), Caliciopsis pinea (GenBank DQ678097.1; Identities = 781/843 (93 %), 8 gaps (0 %)), and Caliciopsis beckhausii (GenBank NG_060418.1; Identities = 789/855 (92 %), 5 gaps (0 %)). Jeremyomyces Crous & R.K. Schumach., gen. nov. MycoBank MB829307. Etymology: Name refers to Jeremy, a young man who due to social circumstances has to live in a children\u2019s home in Germany.

Typus: Germany, near Berlin, on twig of Salix alba (Salicaceae), 21 Jan. 2017, R.K. Schumacher, HPC 1956 (holotype CBS H-23817, culture ex-type CPC 33154 = CBS 144617). Notes: Morphologically Jeremyomyces is similar to Angustimassarina (Thambugala et al. 2015), except that it has a coelomycetous asexual morph. Strangely, the LSU sequence clusters with the type sequence of Acericola italica, a fungus that is morphologically quite distinct, having brown, three-septate ascospores. This suggests that the GenBank sequence of Acericola is incorrect. Based on this sequence however, this fungus was placed in a new genus, Acericola, rather than Setomelanomma, which is probably where it belongs. Based on a megablast search of NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database, the closest hits using the ITS sequence had highest similarity to Acericola italica (GenBank NR_156344.1; Identities = 523/534 (98 %), 3 gaps (0 %)), Xenophoma puncteliae (as Phoma sp.

Neocucurbitaria and several pyrenochaeta-like genera and their respective families were clarified further by Valenzuela-Lopez et al. (2018). Neocucurbitaria salicis-albae is a new species from Salix. Based on a megablast search of NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database, the closest hits using the ITS sequence had highest similarity to Neocucurbitaria quercina (as Pyrenochaeta quercina, GenBank LT623220.1; Identities = 519/533 (97 %), no gaps), Neocucurbitaria acanthocladae (GenBank MF795766.1; Identities = 515/535 (96 %), 2 gaps (0 %)), and Neocucurbitaria unguis-hominis (as Pyrenochaeta unguis-hominis, GenBank KP794081.1; Identities = 472/490 (96 %), 7 gaps (1 %)).

Schumacher, CWU AS 6293 = HPC 2127 = RKS 116 (holotype CBS H-23832, culture ex-type CPC 34071 = CBS 145039). Neodothidotthia negundinis (Berk. & M.A. Curtis) Crous, comb. nov. MycoBank MB829319. Basionym: Coryneum negundinis Berk. & M.A. Curtis, Grevillea 2(22): 153. 1874. Synonym: Thyrostroma negundinis (Berk. & M.A. Curtis) A.W. Ramaley, Mycotaxon 94: 131. 2006 (2005).

Ramaley 0403, BPI 871821, culture CPC 12928 = CBS 119686. Notes: Thyrostroma negundinis (as Stigmina negundinis, on twigs of Acer negundo, North America) has conidia that are ellipsoid, 2-septate, 25\u201338 \u00d7 12\u201318 \u00b5m, base 4\u20135 \u00b5m diam (Ellis 1971), thus closely fitting with the present collection, although they are phylogenetically distinct. Ramaley (2005) found conidia on the type specimen of Amphisphaeria aspera to be much smaller, namely (10\u2013)12\u201315 \u00d7 6\u20137 \u00b5m, suggesting that the latter collection represents a different species in this complex. Ramaley (2005) and Phillips et al. (2008) showed that Dothidotthia (based on D. symphoricarpi from the USA; CBS 119687) has a Thyrostroma (based on T. compactum, reference strain CBS 335.37) asexual morph, which they ascribed to Thyrostroma negundinis. The link between the two genera has however, not been confirmed in culture. It has thus been proposed to continue using both names until this question has been resolved (Wijayawardene et al. 2014, Rossman et al. 2015). As we show here, Thyrostroma is closely allied, but not congeneric with Dothidotthia, thus both generic names should be retained. Furthermore, the European collection of \u201cThyrostroma negundinis\u201d is allied to D. symphoricarpi, but is phylogenetically distinct, and therefore described here as a new genus, Neodothidotthia. Based on a megablast search of NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database, the closest hits using the ITS sequence had highest similarity to Thyrostroma cornicola (GenBank NR_154514.1; Identities = 517/540 (96 %), 6 gaps (1 %)), Thyrostroma compactum (GenBank MH859911.1; Identities = 516/540 (96 %), 6 gaps (1 %)), and Phaeomycocentrospora cantuariensis (GenBank MH866055.1; Identities = 515/539 (96 %), 6 gaps (1 %)).

Schumacher, HPC 2109 = RKS 101 (holotype CBS H-23590, culture ex-type CPC 33686 = CBS 145029). Notes: Neohelicomyces differs from Tubeufia and allied genera, especially from Helicomyces, in having elongate, erect, conspicuous conidiophores, and differs from Helicosporium based on conidial morphology (Tsui et al. 2006). Based on the species known from their DNA, N. deschampsiae appears to represent a new species, being phylogenetically distinct from T. helicomyces and T. paludosa, which have also been reported from this host (Ellis & Ellis 1997).

Akulov, HPC 2045 = CWU AS 6209 (holotype CBS H-23825, culture ex-type CPC 33711 = CBS 145031). Notes: de Gruyter et al. (2013) introduced the genus Medicopsis to accommodate P. romeroi, a pathogen associated with mycetoma in humans (Ahmed et al. 2014). Medicopsis is phoma-like in morphology, and Neomedicopsis is distinct in having globose, dark brown, thick-walled conidia that arise from long cylindrical conidiogenous cells that proliferate percurrently. Neomedicopsis is somewhat reminiscent of Lasmeniella, except that it lacks multilocular conidiomata.

Wingfield, HPC 309 (holotype CBS H-23794, culture ex-type CPC 27240). Notes: Neophaeoappendicospora is morphologically similar to Phaeoappendicospora, which was established as monotypic genus by Senanayake et al. (2017) for a fungus occurring on dead twigs of Quercus in Thailand. Neophaeoappendicospora leucaenae is distinct from P. thailandensis (ascospores 26\u201334.5 \u00d7 11\u201313 \u03bcm) by its larger ascospores, and the fact that Neophaeoappendicospora readily forms an asexual morph in culture, which is absent in Phaeoappendicospora. Phaeoappendicospora and Neophaeoappendicospora represent genera in a new family, introduced here as Phaeoappendicosporaceae.

Schumacher, HPC 1953 = RKS 12 (holotype CBS H-23820, culture ex-type CPC 33400 = CBS 145037). Pararoussoella mukdahanensis (Phook. et al.) Crous, comb. nov. MycoBank MB829330. Basionym: Roussoella mukdahanensis Phook. et al., Fungal Diversity 82: 32. 2016 (2017). Notes: Species of Thyridariaceae are commonly isolated from various plant substrates. The family was recently treated by Wanasinghe et al. (2018), in which the genus Pararoussoella was established based on its distinct phylogenetic relationship to Roussoella. Pararoussoella juglandicola represents a new member of the genus, which is phylogenetically distinct from other species, including Roussoella mukdahanensis, for which a new combination is required. Based on a megablast search of NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database, the closest hits using the ITS sequence had highest similarity to Roussoella mukdahanensis (GenBank NR_155722.1; Identities = 488/497 (98 %), 1 gap (0 %)), Pararoussoella rosarum (GenBank NR_157529.1; Identities = 492/505 (97 %), 4 gaps (0 %)), and Aaosphaeria arxii (GenBank MH872962.1; Identities = 541/587 (92 %), 7 gaps (1 %)).

Species from this complex known to occur on Eucalyptus include Parafabraea caliginosa, Parafabraea eucalypti, and Pezicula californiae (from Eucalyptus leaves in California, USA). Pezicula eucalyptigena is phylogenetically closely related to P. californiae (conidia 12.5\u201327.5 \u00d7 4.2\u20135.8 \u00b5m), but morphologically distinct in that it has larger conidia (Cheewangkoon et al. 2010, Chen et al. 2016).

On MEA surface dirty white, reverse cinnamon; on PDA surface dirty white, reverse rosy buff; on OA surface rosy vinaceous. Typus: South Africa, Gauteng Province, Gauteng, on leaves of Zea mays (Poaceae), 12 Apr. 2010, T.A. Coutinho, HPC 2038 (holotype CBS H-23814, culture ex-type CPC 33064 = CBS 144614). Notes: Phaeosphaeria leaf spot (PLS) has previously been attributed to Phaeosphaeria maydis (described from leaves of Zea mays in Sao Paulo, Brazil), which has been linked to various asexual morphs including a Phyllosticta sp. (= Guignardia sexual morph), and Phoma maydis. Amaral et al. (2005) reported a phoma-like asexual morph associated with PLS as similar in culture to colonies of Phaeosphaeria maydis, and postulated that several fungal species were involved in causing PLS. However, in a recent study, Gon\u00e7alves et al. (2013) showed that a bacterium, Pantoea ananatis, was the primary disease-causing agent, and that the fungi isolated from these lesions, were secondary colonist of the diseased tissue, stating also that the disease symptoms shown by Amaral et al. (2005) were atypical for PLS. In South Africa, prominent tan-coloured subcircular leaf spots were found on Z. mays to be associated with a new genus, described here as Phaeoseptoriella zeae. Further studies are now required to determine the relative importance of this fungus, and confirm its role as maize pathogen.

Typus: New Zealand, Levin, Earl St, on Phormium tenax, 12 Dec. 1971, G. Laudon, PDD 39822 (neotype designated by Palm 1996); Auckland, Grey Lynn Park, on Phormium tenax (Asphodelaceae), 5 Oct. 2016, R. Thangavel T16_03297D (epitype designated here CBS H-23264, MBT385290, culture ex-epitype CPC 32742 = CBS 144606). Notes: Pseudophaeophleospora was established by Videira et al. (2017) to accommodate a phaeophleospora-like genus occurring on Eucalyptus. The two genera are morphologically similar, and best distinguished based on their DNA sequences. The present collection closely matches the morphology of the neotype of Hendersonia phormii, described by Palm (1996). Unfortunately, the culture used in the latter paper is no longer viable, and could thus not be deposited. The culture from the present collection is thus herewith designated as epitype, to fix the phylogenetic application of the name.

Pseudorobillardaceae Crous, fam. nov. MycoBank MB829342. Etymology: Name refers to the genus Pseudorobillarda. Conidiomata immersed, globose, unilocular, with central ostiole; wall of 3\u20136 layers of thin-walled, flattened textura angularis; conidiomata giving rise to both micro- and macroconidia. Macroconidiophores lining the inner cavity, reduced to conidiogenous cells, hyaline, smooth, doliiform, phialidic with periclinal thickening and flared collarette, or proliferating percurrently when older. Paraphyses numerous, hyphae-like, intermingled among conidiophores, aseptate, flexuous. Macroconidia solitary, septate, guttulate, hyaline, smooth, apex subobtuse, tapering to a truncate base; apical appendages arising from splitting of the conidial sheath, hair-like, flexuous, unbranched, fragile, flexuous, unbranched, mostly absent. Microconidiogenous cells hyaline, smooth, subcylindrical to ampulliform, proliferating percurrently. Microconidia solitary, aseptate, hyaline, smooth, guttulate, subcylindrical, apex obtuse, base truncate; apical appendages hair-like, flexuous, unbranched, fragile, flexuous, unbranched. Type genus: Pseudorobillarda M. Morelet (1968) Type species: Pseudorobillarda phragmitis (Cunnell) M. Morelet. Notes: Pseudorobillarda bolusanthi was recently introduced by Crous et al. (2018b), and placed in the Pseudorobillardaceae (Dothideomycetes). The family, however, was unpublished, and is therefore formally introduced here. Pseudosigmoidea alnicola Crous & R.K. Schumach., sp. nov. MycoBank MB829346. Fig. 49. Etymology: Name reflects the host genus Alnus from which it was isolated. Mycelium consisting of pale brown, smooth, 1.5\u20132 \u00b5m diam hyphae, frequently forming hyphal coils, giving rise to solitary, erect conidiophores, subcylindrical, unbranched, pale brown, smooth, 0\u20131-septate, 10\u201320 \u00d7 2.5\u20133 \u00b5m. Conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal, pale brown, smooth, subcylindrical, 5\u201315 \u00d7 1.5\u20133 \u00b5m; apex with one to several denticles-like loci, 0.5\u20131 \u00d7 1 \u00b5m. Conidia obclavate, flexuous, multi-septate, pale brown, smooth-walled, guttulate, apex subobtuse, base obconically truncate, widest at first basal septum, base bluntly rounded, attached to conidiogenous cell via excentric locus which leaves a cylindrical separating cell on the side of the conidium, 1\u20132 \u00d7 1\u20131.5 \u00b5m, 80\u2013250 \u00d7 3\u20134 \u00b5m, apical region of conidium 1.5\u20132 \u00b5m diam. Culture characteristics: Colonies spreading, with moderate aerial mycelium and smooth, lobate margin, reaching 25 mm diam after 2 wk at 25 \u00b0C. On MEA, PDA and OA, surface and reverse umber. Typus: Germany, near Berlin, alder wood, leaf litter of Alnus glutinosa (Betulaceae), 3 May 2017, R.K. Schumacher, HPC 2100 (holotype CBS H-23826, culture ex-type CPC 33776 = CBS 145034). Notes: Pseudosigmoidea (based on P. cranei), has rhexolytic conidiogenesis with a separating cell, and long, flexuous, subcylindrical to obclavate, septate, hyaline to pale brown, smooth conidia (Ando & Nakamura 2000). Although the genus is listed as Ascomycota \u201cincertae sedis\u201d, this study shows that it resides in the Sympoventuriaceae (Venturiales, Dothidiomycetes). Pseudosigmoidea is known from two species, P. cranei (conidia 26\u2013116.5 \u00d7 1.5\u20132.5 \u00b5m, 3\u20138-septate) and P. ibarakiensis (conidia 68\u2013133 \u00d7 4\u20138 \u00b5m, up to 6-septate; Diene et al. 2013), both of which can easily be distinguished from P. alnicola based on their conidial morphology. Based on a megablast search of NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database, the closest hits using the ITS sequence had highest similarity to Troposporella fumosa (GenBank DQ351724.1; Identities = 564/585 (96 %), 1 gap (0 %)), Helicoma monilipes (GenBank DQ351723.1; Identities = 556/587 (95 %), 4 gaps (0 %)), and Pseudosigmoidea ibarakiensis (GenBank LC146758.1; Identities = 546/577 (95 %), 10 gaps (1 %)).

Conidiophores solitary, erect, medium brown, smooth, subcylindrical, straight to geniculous-sinuous, unbranched, septate, proliferating percurrently. Conidiogenous cells terminal, subcylindrical, straight or flexuous, medium brown, mono- or polyblastic, sometimes sympodial (mainly in culture). Conidia solitary, septate, subcylindrical, straight, apex obtuse, sometimes with a dark cap, base truncate, with or without a minute marginal frill, smooth, pale- to medium brown, guttulate; hilum unthickened, not darkened. Type species: Sympodiella acicola W.B. Kendr. Notes: We emend Sympodiella to include species with a repetophragma-like synasexual morph. A new species is introduced as S. quercina and additionally two new combinations are proposed and discussed below. Sympodiella acicola W.B. Kendr., Trans. Br. Mycol. Soc. 41: 519. 1958. Figs 54\u201356. Typus: UK, Cheshire, on Pinus sylvestris (Pinaceae), 1956, W.B. Kendrick, holotype IMI 69967. Netherlands, Baarn, De Vuursche, on Pinus sylvestris, 12 Apr. 1982, G.S. de Hoog (epitype designated here CBS H-1620 MBT385535, ex-epitype culture CBS 487.82). Synasexual morph repetophragma-like. Conidiophores brown, smooth, proliferating percurrently, up to 25 \u00b5m long, 2\u20133.5 \u00b5m wide at the base. Conidiogenous cells terminal, brown. Conidia 3\u20134(\u20137)-septate, subcylindrical, straight, apex obtuse, base truncate, with a minute marginal frill, smooth, pale- to medium brown, 13\u201335 \u00d7 3\u20134 \u00b5m. Notes: Conidia in S. acicola have been considered arranged in unbranched chains (Kendrick 1958, Seifert et al. 2011). During an examination of the specimen CBS H-1620, some of these conidia resemble phragmoconidia constricted at the septa similar to those described in Wiesneriomyces, since they often remain connected together after they separate from the conidiogenous cells. In culture however (CBS 487.82), they are readily deciduous. Furthermore, in a specimen of Sympodiella acicola (CBS H-1620) the conidiophores were mixed with a repetophragma-like conidiophores described here as the synasexual morph of Sympodiella acicola. Interestingly, in culture (CBS 487.82) we observed some conidiophores with percurrent proliferations and the 1-septate conidia were more abundant than in natural substrate. This species has been reported mainly from Pinus spp. (Kendrick 1958, Ellis 1976). Sympodiella alternata (Tubaki & Saito) Crous & Hern.-Restr., comb. nov. MycoBank MB829352. Fig. 57. Basionym: Endophragmia alternata Tubaki & Saito, Trans. Brit. Mycol. Soc. 52: 477. 1969. Typus: Japan, Sendai, on fallen needles of Pinus densifolia (Pinaceae), 1966, T. Sait\u00f4 (holotype IFO H-11600, ex-type culture IFO 8933 = CBS 326.69). Note: Sympodiella alternata is only known by the repetophragmalike synasexual morph from Asia (Tubaki & Sait\u00f4 1969). During this study we examined the ex-type culture of Sympodiella alternata (CBS 326.69). Conidia were similar to those described in the protologue with a dark cap in the apex of the conidia, but they were slightly smaller with less septa (30\u201336 \u00d7 5\u20136 \u00b5m, 5\u20138-septate vs. (37\u2013)40\u201346(\u201370) \u00d7 5\u20136(\u20137) \u00b5m, (7\u2013)8-septate; Tubaki & Sait\u00f4 1969). The conidiophores proliferate percurrently and sometimes geniculate conidiophores were observed. This species is known from Pinus densifolia from Japan (Tubaki & Sait\u00f4 1969) and from an unknown substrate from China (Shenoy et al. 2006). Sympodiella goidanichii (Rambelli) Crous & Hern.-Restr., comb. nov. MycoBank MB829353. Basionym: Ceratosporella goidanichii Rambelli, R.C. Secc. Accad. Sci. Ist. Bologna, s\u00e9r. 6, 5: 3. 1958. Synonyms: Sporidesmium goidanichii (Rambelli) S. Hughes, N.Z. J. Bot. 17: 162. 1979. Repetophragma goidanichii (Rambelli) W.P. Wu, Fungal Diversity Res. Ser. 15: 80. 2005. Typus: Italy, on cupule of Fagus sylvatica (Fagaceae), collection date unknown, A. Rambelli, ex-type culture CBS 136.58. Note: Sympodiella goidanichii was described from Fagus sylvatica in Italy as Ceratosporella goidanichii (Rambelli 1958). Hughes (1979) considered Ceratosporella goidanichii and Endophragmia alternata as conspecific species and include them in Sporidesmium due to the successive proliferation of the conidiophores. During his studies the type strain of Ceratosporella goidanichhii failed to produce conidia and the observations were based on the sporulating culture of Endophragmia alternata and the descriptions given by Rambelli (1958) and Ellis (1976). Later this species was transferred to Repetophragma, because of the percurrent proliferations of the conidiophores and the presence of euseptate conidia (Wu & Zhuang 2005). In our study the ex-type strain of Ceratosporella goidanichii (CBS 136.58) remains sterile and the new combination in Sympodiella is mainly based on the phylogenetic analysis. Sympodiella quercina Crous & R.K. Schumach., sp. nov. MycoBank MB829351. Figs 58\u201360. Etymology: Name refers to the host genus Quercus from which it was isolated. Mycelium consisting of pale to medium brown, smooth, septate, branched, 2.5\u20133 \u00b5m diam hyphae. Sympodiella-like morph.

Repetophragma-like synasexual morph. Conidiophores solitary, erect, medium brown, smooth, subcylindrical, straight to geniculous-sinuous, unbranched, 2\u20136-septate, 25\u201390 \u00d7 5\u20136 \u00b5m. Conidiogenous cells terminal, subcylindrical, medium brown, 6\u201317 \u00d7 5\u20136 \u00b5m, proliferating percurrently. Conidia solitary, subcylindrical, apex obtuse, base truncate, medium brown (end cells frequently subhyaline), smooth, guttulate, straight, (4\u2013)6-septate, (40\u2013)47\u201355(\u201365) \u00d7 (5\u2013)6\u20136.5(\u20137) um; hilum unthickened, not darkened, 5\u20136.5 \u00b5m diam, with minute marginal frill. Culture characteristics: Colonies erumpent, spreading, with moderate aerial mycelium and smooth, lobate margin, reaching 12 mm diam after 2 wk at 25 \u00b0C. On MEA surface umber, reverse chestnut; on PDA surface umber, reverse iron-grey; on OA surface umber. Typus: Germany, near Berlin, in Pinus sylvestris forest, on fallen leaf of Quercus robur (Fagaceae), 19 Aprs. 2017, H. Schreiber & R.K. Schumacher, HPC 2106 = RKS 94 (holotype CBS H-23829, culture ex-type CPC 33903 = CBS 145028). Additional material examined: UK, Lancashire, on leaf litter of Betula sp., 17 Jan. 1968, deposited by J.C. Frankland, CBS 987.70. Notes: In natural substrate this species has repetophragma-like conidiophores up to 210 \u00b5m long with percurrent proliferations and conidia measuring 32\u201344 \u00d7 5\u20137 \u00b5m, with or without a dark cap in the apex of the conidia. Next to repetophragma-like conidiophores, Sympodiella conidiophores were also found, and since the close phylogenetic relationship with Sympodiella acicola we also described the synasexual morph. In this species the Sympodiella type of conidiophores produce fragile hyaline phragmoconidia similar to those observed in Cylindrosympodium (Kendrick & Casta\u00f1eda 1990) and some species of Subulispora (Sutton 1973, Kirk 1985). Additionally, the superficial network of darkly pigmented hyphae described in S. acicola (Kendrick 1985) was also observed in S. quercina. An additional strain (CBS 987.70) previously identified as Repetophragma goidanichii was phylogenetically related with S. quercina. However, the conidial sizes observed in this culture are below the range observed in CPC 33903, and also have more septa (35\u201350 \u00d7 4\u20137 \u00b5m, 6\u20137(\u20139)-septate), the dark apical cap was only evident in some of the younger conidia, and conidiophores were not well-developed. The synasexual morph was not observed in any of the cultures of S. quercina. Based on a megablast search of NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database, the closest hits using the ITS sequence had highest similarity to Sporidesmium goidanichii (GenBank MH860019.1; Identities = 486/489 (99 %), 2 gaps (0 %)), Septonema crispulum (GenBank MH862607.1; Identities = 402/445 (90 %), 8 gaps (1 %)), and Sympodiella acicola (GenBank KY853468.1; Identities = 432/488 (89 %), 18 gaps (3 %)).

Notes: This very obvious fungus was first seen on leaves where conidia were surrounded by tissue with a green-blue discolouration, which was different from the normal foliicolous coelomycetes on Eucalyptus that generally have structures with shades of brown to black. In culture, it again produced greenish grey colonies on MEA.

(Typhaceae), Desm., exsiccata \u201cPlantes Cryptogames de France, ed. 2: no. 1428 (1848)\u201d (lectotype designated here in PC, MBT385534). Germany, near Berlin, leaf of Typha sp. (Typhaceae), 1 Apr. 2017, R.K. Schumacher, HPC 2025 = RKS 84 (epitype designated here CBS H-23819, MBT385272, culture ex-epitype CPC 33271 = CBS 145043). Notes: This fungus occurs commonly in Europe, sporulates well in culture, but produced only the sexual morph in the present study. Tennakoon et al. (2016) introduced the genus Juncaceicola and the combination J. typharum, but could not locate any type material of Sphaeria scirpicola var. typharum, and based their new combination on CBS 296.54 (on Nardus stricta, Switzerland), which probably represents an undescribed species of Juncaceicola. Although phylogenetically distinct, there is morphologically little to choose between Typhicola and Juncaceicola, and the two genera are best distinguished based on DNA data. Based on a megablast search of NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database, the closest hits using the ITS sequence had highest similarity to Juncaceicola typharum (as Leptosphaeria typharum, GenBank AF439465.1; Identities = 507/518 (98 %), 1 gap (0 %)), Pleospora typhicola (GenBank KF636768.1; Identities = 453/486 (93 %), 12 gaps (2 %)), and Neocamarosporium goegapense (GenBank KJ869163.1; Identities = 519/587 (88 %), 26 gaps (4 %)).

Notes: Wojnowiciella dactylidis was described from Dactylis glomerata collected in Italy, and this is the first record from New Zealand. Unfortunately, only the microconidial morph was observed in culture. Based on a megablast search of NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database, the closest hits using the ITS sequence had highest similarity to Wojnowiciella dactylidis (GenBank LT990660.1; Identities = 572/572 (100 %), no gaps), Wojnowiciella cissampeli (GenBank NR_155972.1; Identities = 568/579 (98 %), 6 gaps (1 %)), and Wojnowicia rosicola (GenBank MG828979.1; Identities = 554/568 (98 %), 8 gaps (1 %)).

Xenodevriesiaceae Crous, fam. nov. MycoBank MB829462. Xenodevriesia Crous, gen. nov. MycoBank MB829365. Etymology: Name reflects the fact that this is similar to, but distinct from the genus Devriesia. Mycelium consisting of medium brown, smooth, septate, branched hyphae. Conidiophores dimorphic. Microconidiophores reduced to conidiogenous cells on hyphae, erect, cylindrical, medium brown, smooth with truncate ends, proliferating sympodially. Macroconidiophores erect, cylindrical, straight to geniculate-sinuous, medium brown, smooth, unbranched or branched above, septate. Conidiogenous cells terminal or lateral on branched conidiophores, medium brown, smooth, cylindrical, proliferating sympodially; loci truncate, inconspicuous, somewhat darkened, not refractive.

Type species: Xenodevriesia strelitziicola (Arzanlou & Crous) Crous. Xenodevriesia strelitziicola (Arzanlou & Crous) Crous, comb. nov. MycoBank MB829366. Basionym: Devriesia strelitziicola Arzanlou & Crous, Stud. Mycol. 64: 38. 2009. Notes: Devriesia strelitziicola was introduced by Crous et al. (2009b) for a fungus that was devriesia-like and pseudocercospora-like in morphology, but which proved to be phylogenetically distinct from both genera. It is morphologically distinct from Devriesia in that it does not produce chlamydospores, and from Peudocercospora in that the conidial hila are somewhat darkened and thickened. Phylogenetically, it is also clearly distinct, and represents a new family in Capnodiales. Zasmidium hakeicola Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB829367. Fig. 66.

Typus: Australia, New South Wales, Australian Botanical Garden Mount Annan, on leaves of Hakea corymbosa (Proteaceae), 25 Nov. 2016, P.W. Crous, HPC 1722 (holotype CBS H-23806, culture ex-type CPC 32703 = CBS 144590). Notes: A morphologically similar species, Zasmidium grevilleae (conidia 3\u20137(\u201312)-septate, (30\u2013)50\u201365(\u201380) \u00d7 (5\u2013)6\u20137 \u03bcm), was described from leaves of Grevillea decurrens collected in Australia (Crous et al. 2009a, Videira et al. 2017). The present collection from Hakea differs from that species in having shorter, wider conidia, with fewer septa. Based on a megablast search of NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database, the closest hits using the ITS sequence had highest similarity to Zasmidium grevilleae (GenBank NR_156522.1; Identities = 533/538 (99 %), 1 gap (0 %)), Zasmidium proteacearum (as Verrucisporota proteacearum, GenBank FJ839635.1; Identities = 513/539 (95 %), 23 gaps (4 %)), and Zasmidium velutinum (as Periconiella velutina, GenBank EU041781.1; Identities = 492/545 (90 %), 16 gaps (2 %)).

Crous, HPC 1734, CBS H-23580, culture CPC 32120 = CBS 144442. Notes: Zygosporium pseudogibbum (on Eucalyptus leaves from Malaysia; Crous et al. 2018c) is closely related to Z. gibbum, a European taxon (reference isolate, FMR 13130 = CBS 137306; leaf litter Canary Islands; Hern\u00e1ndez-Restrepo et al. 2017). Morphologically these taxa are very similar and they are thus best distinguished based on their DNA sequences. Based on a megablast search of NCBI\u2019s GenBank nucleotide database, the closest hits using the ITS sequence had highest similarity to Zygosporium mycophilum (GenBank MH856563.1; Identities = 562/565 (99 %), 2 gaps (0 %)), Zygosporium pseudogibbum (GenBank NR_159072.1; Identities = 551/554 (99 %), 2 gaps (0 %)), and Zygosporium masonii (GenBank MH860771.1; Identities = 527/567 (93 %), 16 gaps (2 %)).

The tub2 sequence had highest similarity to Zygosporium pseudogibbum (GenBank MH108055.1; Identities = 461/475 (97 %), 1 gap (0 %)); other distant hits include Hypoxylon crocopeplum (GenBank AY951711.1; Identities = 739/798 (93 %), no gaps), Hypoxylon calileguense (GenBank KU604579.1; Identities = 739/799 (92 %), no gaps), and Dicyma funiculosa (GenBank KU684134.1; Identities = 830/937 (89 %), 11 gaps (1 %)). Addendum: validation of names and typifications During the course of this study we encountered several names that were invalid based on the International Code of nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (see MycoBank and Index Fungorum) due to a variety of reasons. As this has led to problems with new combinations or genera and families subsequently based on these names also being rendered invalid, and thus we decided to validate these names below.
